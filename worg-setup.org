* How does Worg publish itself as a website?

The [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg][Worg git repository]] is hosted on SourceHut.

The [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg/tree/master/item/.build.yml][build manifest]] takes care of running the [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg/tree/master/item/publish.sh][publish.sh script]] and
uploading the generated HTML pages to the orgmode.org server.

When you push a commit, it can take up to 10 minutes for the change to
be visible online.  You can [[https://builds.sr.ht/~bzg/worg][check the build status here]].

You can adapt this =publish.sh= script (especially the =org-mode= and
=htmlize.el= load path) to test it locally.

You can also inspect the [[nginx.conf][nginx configuration]] of the server exposing
orgmode.org.

* Are there any writing conventions?

Please don't use [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables][file variables]] in your org files.

Also see the [[file:worg-editing.org][worg-editing]] page for more suggestions.

* Can Worg execute code (via Babel)?

No.  The default automated export does not allow code execution on the
server for obvious security reasons.
