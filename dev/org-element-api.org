=org-element.el= implements a parser according to Org's [[./org-syntax.org][syntax
specification]].

The library contains tools to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST)
from an Org buffer, to analyze the syntactical object at point.
[[#parsing][Parsing functions]] are detailed in the first part of the document,
along with their relative accessors and setters.

Upon parsing, each token in an Org document gets a type and some
properties attached to it.  This information can be extracted and
modified with provided [[#accessors][accessors]] and [[#setters][setters]].  An exhaustive list of
all types and attributes is given in section [[#attributes]].

Eventually, the library is packed with a few useful functions,
described in the [[#other-tools][last section]] of the document.

* Parsing functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: parsing
:END:

There are two ways to parse a buffer using this library: either
locally or globally.

[[#local][Local parsing]] gives information about the structure at point.
Depending on the level of detail required, ~org-element-at-point~ and
~org-element-context~ fullfill that role.

[[#global][Global parsing]] is done with ~org-element-parse-buffer~, which returns
the AST representing the document.

** Analyzing the structure at point
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: local
:END:

~org-element-at-point~ offers a glimpse into the local structure of
the document.  However, it stops at the element level.  It doesn't,
for example, analyze the contents of a paragraph.  While this is
sufficient for many use cases, ~org-element-context~ allows to go
deeper, down to the object level.  The following example illustrates
the difference between the two functions.

#+name: context-vs-at-point
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*Lorem ipsum dolor* sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
#+END_SRC

Indeed, calling ~org-element-at-point~ at the beginning of the
paragraph returns a ~paragraph~ structure, whereas calling
~org-element-context~ returns a ~bold~ object.

Unless point is on a headline, both functions indirectly return all
parents of the value within the current section[fn:1], through
~:parent~ property.  For example, when point is at =(X)=

#+name: full-hierarchy
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Headline

,#+BEGIN_CENTER
Paragraph(X)
,#+END_CENTER
#+END_SRC

~org-element-at-point~ returns a ~paragraph~ element, whose ~:parent~
property contains a ~center-block~ element, which, in turn, has no
~:parent~ since the next ancestor is the section itself.

** Creating a snapshot of the document
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: global
:END:

~org-element-parse-buffer~ completely parses a (possibly narrowed)
buffer into an AST.  The virtual root node has type ~org-data~ and no
properties attached to it.

Unlike to local parsing functions, data obtained through
~org-element-parse-buffer~ can be altered to your heart's content.
See [[#setters]] for a list of related tools.

* Accessors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: accessors
:END:

Type and properties of a given element or object are obtained with,
respectively, ~org-element-type~ and ~org-element-property~.

~org-element-contents~ returns an ordered (by buffer position) list of
all elements or objects within a given element or object.  Since local
parsing ignores contents, it only makes sense to use this function on
a part of an AST.

Eventually, ~org-element-map~ operates on an AST, a part of it, or any
list of elements or objects.  It is a versatile function.

For example, it can be used to collect data from an AST.  Hence the
following snippet returns all paragraphs beginning a section in the
current document.  Note that equality between elements is tested with
~eq~.

#+name: collect
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'paragraph
  (lambda (paragraph)
    (let ((parent (org-element-property :parent paragraph)))
      (and (eq (org-element-type parent) 'section)
           (let ((first-child (car (org-element-contents parent))))
             (eq first-child paragraph))
           ;; Return value.
           paragraph))))
#+end_src

It can also be used as a predicate.  Thus, the following snippet
returns a non-~nil~ value when the document contains a checked item.

#+name: checkedp
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'item
  (lambda (item) (eq (org-element-property :checkbox item) 'on))
  nil t)
#+end_src

See ~org-element-map~'s docstring for more examples.

* Setters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: setters
:END:

~org-element-put-property~ modifies any property of a given element or
object.

Note that, even though structures obtained with local parsers are
mutable, it is good practice to consider them immutable.  In
particular, destructively changing properties relative to buffer
positions is likely to break the caching mechanism running in the
background.  If, for example, you need to slightly alter an element
obtained using these functions, first copy it, using
~org-element-copy~, before modifying it by side effect.  There is no
such restriction for elements grabbed from a complete AST.

The library also provides tools to manipulate the parse tree.  Thus,
~org-element-extract-element~ removes an element or object from an
AST, ~org-element-set-element~ replaces one with another, whereas
~org-element-insert-before~ and ~org-element-adopt-element~ insert
elements within the tree, respectively before a precise location or
after all children.

* Types and Attributes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: attributes
:END:

Each greater element, element and object has a variable set of
properties attached to it.  Among them, four are shared by all types:
~:begin~ and ~:end~, which refer to the beginning and ending buffer
positions of the considered element or object, ~:post-blank~, which
holds the number of blank lines, or white spaces, at its end[fn:2] and
~:parent~, which refers to the element or object containing it.

Greater elements containing objects on the one hand, and elements or
objects containing objects on the other hand also have
~:contents-begin~ and ~:contents-end~ properties to delimit contents.

In addition to these properties, each element can optionally get some
more from affiliated keywords, namely: ~:caption~, ~:header~, ~:name~,
~:plot~, ~:results~ or ~:attr_NAME~ where =NAME= stands for the name
of an export back-end.

Also, ~:post-affiliated~ property is attached to all elements.  It
refers to the buffer position after any affiliated keyword, when
applicable, or to the beginning of the element otherwise.

The following example illustrates the relationship between position
properties.

#+name: position-properties
#+BEGIN_SRC org -n -r
,#+NAME: dont-do-this-at-home (ref:begin)
,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp       (ref:post)
(/ 1 0)
,#+END_SRC

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do (ref:end)
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
#+END_SRC

The first element's type is ~src-block~.  Its ~:begin~ property
(respectively ~:end~ property) is the buffer position at the beginning
of line [[(begin)]] (respectively line [[(end)]]).  ~:post-affiliated~ is the
buffer position at the beginning of line [[(post)]].  Since source blocks
cannot contain other elements or objects, both ~:contents-begin~ and
~:contents-end~ are ~nil~. ~:post-blank~ is 1.

below.

** Turning an AST into an Org document

~org-element-interpret-data~ is the reciprocal operation of
~org-element-parse-buffer~.  When provided an element, object, or even
a full parse tree, it generates an equivalent string in Org syntax.

More precisely, output is a normalized document: it preserves
structure and blank spaces but it removes indentation and capitalize
keywords.  As a consequence it is equivalent, but not equal, to the
original document the AST comes from.

When called on an element or object obtained through
~org-element-at-point~ or ~org-element-context~, its contents will not
appear, since this information is not available.

** Examining genealogy of an element or object

~org-element-lineage~ produces a list of all ancestors of a given
element or object.  However, when these come from a [[#local][local parsing
function]], lineage is limited to the section containing them.

With optional arguments, it is also possible to check for a particular
type of ancestor.  See function's docstring for more information.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Thus, ~org-element-at-point~ cannot return the parent of
a headline.  Nevertheless, headlines are context free elements: it is
efficient to move to parent headline (e.g., with
~org-up-heading-safe~) before analyzing it.

[fn:2] As a consequence whitespaces or newlines after an element or
object still belong to it.  To put it differently, ~:end~ property of
an element matches ~:begin~ property of the following one at the same
level, if any.
