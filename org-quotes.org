Someone mentioned that org-mode is a bit like perl. I agree. Way back,
someone described perl as "the Swiss army chainsaw of UNIX
programming". Over the last 12 months, I think org mode has evolved
into something akin to the "Swiss army JCB of organisational software"
(to stretch a metaphor until it screams for mercy!).  @@html:<div

While on-topic, just want to clear up misconceptions of org-mode. It
is different from all the software/website task managers mentioned
here. You can think of it as a meta-organization tool. A org software
factory if you will. You can customize it to exactly how you want your
thoughts, tasks, notes, etc organized.  See
http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html for an idea of the sheer breadth of
options available to make it work exactly for you.  This may sound
like a lot of work, but there are a lot of sensible defaults, which is
why most org-mode tutorials that scratch the surface make it seem like
a sibling to other task management software. [...]  If I may pilfer
a quote, org-mode "outshines other [task management solutions] in
approximately the same way the noonday sun does the stars." (Neal
Stephenson on Emacs)\\

stuff that others talk about on this list, but I can make a functional
web site with Org without trouble by using the basic export functions.
Adding new pages, editing old pages, and updating is trivial. I know
a lot of people who use Markdown and static site generators, but Org
is much better for my purposes. And I can use it for many other things
too.  Sorry for this unnecessary rant, but I just love Org.

* Some 24/7 lectures about Org-mode

The famous 24/7 lectures are part of the ceremony for handing out the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize][Ig Nobel Prizes]].  All speakers have to give a 24/7 lecture on their
subject. This means, they have to give a /complete technical
description/ of their work in /24 words/ (may be totally cryptic), and
then a /7 word/ explanation that is more or less /understandable for
the public/, and it may be either tongue in cheek or serious.  In
summer 2008, a few people tried to [[https://orgmode.org/list/3A44135C-FC7A-4D2C-AA74-A68B5F45BA1B@gmail.com][formulate]] such lectures about
Org-mode:

** Technical description in 24 words

These was only a single entry in the "24" category:

  - Org-mode does outlining, note-taking, hyperlinks, spreadsheets,
    TODO lists, project planning, GTD, HTML and LaTeX authoring, all
    with plain text files in Emacs (/Carsten Dominik/)

** Simple summary in 7 words

   This is only a selection of the submitted entries.  My loose
   criterion was to use entries that are either a good description or
   are funny - both valid approaches to the "7" part of 24/7 lectures.
   I also left a few entries which are not exactly seven words,
   because I liked them a lot.

   - Organize and track everything in plain text (/Bernt Hansen/)

   - Organize outlines, lists and table in text. (/Eddward DeVilla/)

   - Emacs Org Mode: your life in text (/Matthew Parker/)

   - Do work and play in plain text (/Kene Meniru/)

   - Madness? This is org-mode! [[http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUgrsNBu51nU][*Real Spartans use emacs!*]] (/Russell
     Adams[fn:2]/)

   - Plain text with frickin' lasers. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil][*pinky to lips*]] (/Russell
     Adams[fn:2]/)

   - It is the text that binds us. [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3Dshikaka][*Shekaka!*]] (/Russell Adams[fn:2]/)


   - Org-mode --- lifehacker's orgy :-P (/Dmitry Dzhus/)

   - Back to the future for plain text (/Carsten Dominik/)

[fn:1] Muse now understands the syntax of Org-mode tables, so you can use
Orgtbl-mode to get the same tables in Muse.

[fn:2] The linked text is from Adam, but the link itself has been added
by me.
