* Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

Like many Free Software projects Org has an active IRC channel on the
Libera.chat IRC network. IRC is a form of real time chat with other users
who join the network and are participating in the channel.

 - Org IRC channel details
   - Network :: https://libera.chat/
   - IRC Server :: irc.libera.chat
   - Channel :: #org-mode
   - Web client :: https://web.libera.chat/#org-mode

* Nickname Registration

Currently you do not require a registered nickname with Libera.chat to
join the Org channel. This may be subject to change if spam becomes an
issue.

* IRC Guidelines

IRC is a highly asynchronous form of chat. If the channel is not busy,
don't be discouraged. Users come and go and watch the history.

When you join the channel, there is no need to ask whether you can ask
a question. Please ask directly what you would like to discuss, and
wait for a reply. You may wait quite some time so don't ask and quit
five minutes later.

Be polite and respect other users. Rude behavior and spam are not
tolerated.

Examples of etiquette guides from other channels:

 - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines
 - https://libera.chat/guidelines#basic-irc-netiquette

Please consider using a privacy friendly paste service for posting
code, like http://bpaste.net/ .
