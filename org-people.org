# Ian Barton ------------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Ian Barton,http://orgmode.org/img/people/ian_barton.jpg)}}}

I started out in a farming family before going into medical research
as a virologist an then into computing. I have now returned to
farming, where I hope I'll stay!

I have only been using Emacs for two or three years and had been
looking for something that allowed me to keep all my information in
plain text. When I discovered org I knew that I had found the Holy
Grail.

Org develops so rapidly that every time I wonder if I can do "x" in
org, it's either already implemented, or one of Carsten's multiple
beings creates it overnight. However, despite rapid development and
many features org's core functions remain simple to use.

Outside farming and playing with computers I try to indulge my passion
for mountaineering, which I am trying to pass on to my three young
children, who are sometimes reluctant companions in our adventures!

# Charles Cave ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person200(Charles Cave,http://orgmode.org/img/people/charles_cave.jpg)}}}

I started using Emacs on Unix workstations in the early 1990s but now
I use Windows desktop machines.

I was using XEmacs for my Perl programming work in my role of a
software tester for a Sydney based software company.  Around 2007 I
discovered David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology through web
sites such as [[http://www.43folders.com]] and
[[http://www.diyplanner.com/]]. I later created a portal of GTD resources
[[http://gtdportal.pbworks.com/]]

I stumbled upon the Planner mode for emacs, then did more research on
Emacs outliners and found org-mode. What attracted me to org-mode was
keeping all information in one file and the outlining commands were so
simple. The format of an org-mode was very logical and easy to
generate and parse using scripts in Perl or Python.

XEmacs soon gave way to GNU Emacs which is friendlier to org-mode and
in my opinion, a better Emacs.  My other useful Emacs package is
mup-mode for typesetting music using the [[http://www.arkkra.com][MUP program]]. I also use
org-mode to publish articles for the web about GTD, org-mode and my
music making.

org-mode and Remember mode are another great combination of tools.
I capture my thoughts, ideas, notes, journal entries, and Internet
banking receipts into plain text files.

I want to tell the world about org-mode so I write articles on how I
have used org-mode in my daily life. I work as a technical writer of
training materials, and I naturally enjoy writing to help people
understand how to use technology. My articles can be found at
[[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/]]
I couldn't live without org-mode! Each new release
has exciting new features.

# Dan Davison -----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Dan Davison,http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~davison/dan.jpg)}}}

I'm a university-based researcher in evolutionary biology/genetics. In
addition to using org-mode for all my task and project management, I
now use it as my working environment for programming and data
analysis, which I can highly recommend.

Although I'd used emacs for a few years beforehand, encountering
org-mode finally motivated me to learn emacs-lisp, which I have really
appreciated (I had previously found it strangely refractory). The
community of org users is providing a constant stream of high quality
new additions, and when you have any doubts about how to proceed
yourself, it is a spectacularly helpful and reliable source of
knowledge.

I am working with Eric Schulte on [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/org-babel.php][org-babel]] which aims to extend
org-mode as an interactive environment for tasks involving
programming, by allowing source code blocks in many languages to be
executed. I have [[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~davison/software/dbm/dbm.php][one other software project]] outside my work; its aim
is to use the large amounts of information about musical similarity
available online to organise and navigate a personal music
library. Speaking of music, I am [[http://www.last.fm/user/Myrmornis][Myrmornis]] on [[http://www.last.fm/][last.fm]].

When I get away from my computer I tend to try to go far from
computers in general. In the last few years my birding/camping trips
have been to the more remote areas of northern Finland, Romania,
western Ethiopia and Panama.

# Carsten Dominik -------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Carsten Dominik,http://orgmode.org/img/people/carsten_dominik.jpg)}}}

I am the main Org-mode author, being on this project since 2003.

Just like my earlier Emacs hacks [[http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html][RefTeX]], [[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex/][CDLaTeX]], and [[http://idlwave.org][IDLWave]], writing
[[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] resulted from a direct need for it: I wanted to get organized
and wanted to do it in Emacs.  There was nothing available that fit my
wishes, in particular no combination of outline-based note-taking with
task management in a single system.

With lots of help from the community around Org-mode, this project has
grown into a versatile toolbox, which is being used by a large number
of people, in various ways and to various ends.

Org-mode was largely written on the commuter train to Amsterdam, where
I [[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/][work]] as an [[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html][Astronomer]] at the [[http://www.astro.uva.nl][Astronomical Institute]] of the
[[http://www.uva.nl][University of Amsterdam]].

# Thomas S Dye ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person200(Thomas S Dye,http://www.tsdye.com/images/tom.jpg)}}}

I am an archaeologist (http://www.tsdye.com/) who switched to Linux
almost 20 years ago when the demise of DOS made most of my little
Turbo Pascal utilities obsolete.  My outrage at the irresponsibility
made possible by proprietary standards led me to discover the Free
Software Foundation and, of course, emacs, which has been central to
my computing life ever since.

With no formal computer science training and a wide range of other
interests that keep me from doing anything more than dabbling at
programming, I typically stumble across cool emacs features by
accident rather than design.  Sometimes these features change the way
I conceptualize a problem and the space of possible solutions.  A
short list, roughly in the order I discovered them, includes regular
expression search and replace; emacs as an interface for other
applications, like python and R; reftex, whose manual (written by
Carsten, I believe) suggests generating an index by creating a list of
unique words over a certain size found in a document, then letting
reftex guide the markup process, one unique word at a time (!); and,
most recently, org-babel, which seems to this non-programmer as equal
parts simplicity and magic.

I'm currently integrating org-mode + org-babel into my research
workflow. Here, org-mode is half organizer (thanks to Bernt Hansen's
terrific how-to) and laboratory notebook. The org file is structured
with an eye to creating a meta-document that describes the conduct of
the research, from the mundane practical details of the lab work,
through the reasoning behind analytic decisions, and on to choices
behind presentation of results.

I'm using org-babel to tangle two LaTeX source files -- the document
I'll submit for publication, and a beamer presentation.  Org-babel's
ability to tangle (and weave) source code from several languages at
once means that my meta-document can record most of what I do, as I do
it: SQL queries and my reasons for believing they yield correct
results with respect to some specific goal; short statistical analyses
in R and my reasons for believing their results answer particular
questions; creation of graphics with ggplot2 and the design decisions
behind them; and of course the LaTeX source, along with my reasons for
presenting particular content in the order that I choose.

I think I'm using the literate programming facilities of org-babel to
create a piece of reproducible research, but the workflow is still
developing.  All I can be certain of at this stage is that org-babel
has me thinking in new ways.  What fun!


# Eric S. Fraga ---------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person200(Eric S. Fraga,http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/27579696.JPG)}}}

I am a computer scientist working with chemical engineers, doing
research in optimisation and automated design methods.  Org-mode is a
key tool in the management of both my research programme and my
teaching activities.

Being based on simple text files and being open source, Org-mode is
attractive for being future-proof.  It allows me to no longer worry
about whether I'm locked in to some software vendor's changing view of
what is important or necessary and I know that all the information I
have put into my org files is and always will be accessible.

Org-mode provides me with an excellent framework for collaborative
work.  As it is available on a very wide range of devices, including
hand-held computers, the full power of the system is at hand no matter
where I am working.

My [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucecesf/][web pages]], describing my research activities and interests, are all
written in Org.  Lately, I have been experimenting with literate
programming using Org with the recently added org-babel framework!

My contribution to the Org-mode project is mostly as an enthusiastic
user!

# Peter Frings

{{{person(Peter Frings,http://orgmode.org/img/people/peter_frings.jpg)}}}

I'm part of a software team in Mortsel, Belgium, as a requirement
analyst, conceptual designer, interaction designer, graphic designer
and spec writer ---or whatever the titles are---; i.e., the whole
shebang except programming. I do miss programming a bit, which I did
professionally during the first 10 years of my career. That itch
sparked my current interest in functional programming, but I lack the
time to do anything serious with it.

Although I'm not an artist, I like photography ('grepe' on Flickr),
and I play the double bass in a couple of folk bands.

Being an avid emacs user, I stumbled upon Org-mode and never looked
back. I use it mainly to start writing ideas and concepts, to-do list
and scheduler and to track the time I spend on the various tasks. I'm
pretty sure I'm only using 5% of what it can do, especially given the
furious pace of development in the last year. Nothing compares to the
Org community, with Carsten et all on top (how can people fix a bug
faster than you can read the problem report?).

I <3 Org-mode. Spread the word!

# Bastien Guerry --------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Bastien Guerry,http://api.ning.com/files/LwgxVloM62IRf1TIIH3rC*v9UqiIHkYEb0DQcxOqOIc_/bastien_guerry2.jpg)}}}

Over the past decade, I have been studying philosophy, cognitive
sciences and educational theories.  I'm interested on how to use
computers for education, and I'm a consultant in this field.

I'm not a programmer but I've been raised in Emacs, so I can read 
some elisp code, fix some bugs and sometimes write a function.

My first Emacs contribution was [[http://directory.fsf.org/project/BHL/][BHL]], a mode to convert plain text to
HTML, LaTeX, etc.  When I discovered Org I thought: "Wow.  This is the
perfect tool for playing with ideas I'm too lazy to implement in BHL."
And it turned out to be much more than that: Org has been a matrix for
many new ideas that I couldn't have dreamt for with BHL.

Org is to Emacs what Emacs is to computers.

And nothing compares to the Org community.

# Bernt Hansen ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Bernt Hansen,http://www.norang.ca/pics/Bernt.jpg)}}}

I am a freelance software designer working from my office near Toronto,
Ontario, Canada.  I use Org-mode to track all of my personal and
business tasks.

Org-mode was the end of my long quest to find a better organizational
toolkit.  I had tried many other systems over the years in an attempt to
get organized.

I started using Org-mode in August 2006 after trying out planner for a
year.  I needed something to track time spent on tasks and a note filing
system where I could actually find the notes back again and in a
reasonable amount of time.  Being able to actually read the note was an
added bonus -- my handwriting is awful - especially when I'm in a hurry
such as making notes during a client conversation.  Fortunately for me I
can type faster than I can write.

Since then Org-mode has continued to evolve and it has many more
features than I will ever need from my organizational software suite.
I'm no longer searching for a better organizational toolkit.

# Wes Hardaker ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Wes Hardaker,http://www.hardakers.net/images/wes-tammerack.jpg)}}}

I like to bite off more than I can chew on a regular basis.  I'm
actively involved in a ton of things.  I'm an avid
[[http://www.capturedonearth.com/][Photographer]], a
[[http://www.ws6z.com/][Amateur Radio]] enthusiast, and Community
Emergency Response Team supporter.  I love hiking
([[http://www.openstreetmap.org/][making maps of everywhere I go]])
and enjoy finding [[http://yamar.geoqo.org/][Geocaches]].  All of this
takes coordination, organization and careful tracking of the things
that I have yet to accomplish.  I think faster than my fingers can
frequently write down [[http://pontifications.hardakers.net][my ideas and thoughts]].

Org-mode has certainly made managing my overwhelming
list of things I need to do, want to do or simply thinking of much
easier.  I don't feel nearly as lost since I've started using it.

I participate in a [[http://www.hardakers.net/][large number]]
of [[http://www.hardakers.net/][open source projects]]
(both for work and pleasure) and have contributed at least
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-export-generic.php][at least
a little bit to org]] via my org-export-generic functionality.

Thanks a bunch to Carsten and everyone else for writing such a
wonderful package!

# Manuel Hermenegildo --------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Manuel Hermenegildo,http://www.software.imdea.org/images/manuel_hermenegildo.jpg)}}}

I am a researcher (and the director of) a research institute and a
university research group, both in Computer Science.  Org has had a
huge positive impact in the way I organize my (unfortunately many)
tasks --and in fact my life as a whole. It is also used by many people
in the institute and the research groups I am part of.

We participate in a large number of projects, from research projects
to simply taskforces regarding many organizational aspects of our
institute, and make extensive and collaborative use of org to get
organized within them. We used /shared/ org files, essentially one per
project, to gather our notes, tasks, deadlines, etc. for that project.
These files are kept in a server and we edit them collaboratively
using svn or git. People include as their org-agenda-files those of
the projects they are involved in.  We use tags to assign tags to
peope (e.g., my tag is :MH:).  In private org files we use FILETAGS to
assign all the tasks in the files to the owner of the file.  Then, we
use tag filters to generate agendas and todo lists that only have our
tasks. This is far simpler and more flexible than any of the other
methods of getting organized that we have seen so far!  And it is all
in simple ascii files and through emacs... happiness.

I cannot say as others that org is the main reason I use emacs: in
fact, it is scary to think about when I started using emacs (1983?).
But org has done something truly amazing: make emacs even more useful
(and very much so!)  than it already was for me. Try it for yourself
--you will not be disappointed!

# Tassilo Horn ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person(Tassilo Horn,http://www.tsdh.de/~heimdall/tsdh.jpg)}}}

I started using Emacs about the same time I've switched to GNU/Linux
around 1999.  When people are saying they switched to Emacs because of
org-mode, for me it was the Gnus newsreader, which I'm still using
today.

Over the time, I've learned elisp and gotten my hands dirty in several
projects, like EMMS, Gnus, and Circe.  And I'm the author of doc-view,
which is integrated in Emacs 23.  In org-mode, I'm in charge of the
linking stuff between Org and Gnus.

Org has become the most important part of my workflow: if I didn't
org-remember it, it won't be done!

In my free time, I'm trying to do as much crazy stuff as possible:
parachuting, hang gliding, rock climbing, snowboarding, and cooking!
Believe me, the last thing's the most dangerous.

On my day job, I'm a researcher at the Institute for Software
Technology at the University Koblenz-Landau, where my main interests
are MDA and especially model transformations.

You can find me as tsdh on IRC in #emacs, #gnus, and #org-mode.

# Andrew Hyatt ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person400(Andrew Hyatt,http://lh5.ggpht.com/_JOGKg1oOsqk/Su2mDWjG1SI/AAAAAAAADYE/G0sRrzjpvIw/DSC_0021.JPG)}}}

During my first year of college, I was introduced to emacs, and I've
been increasing my usage of it ever since.  I use it to read mail,
chat, code in C++, Java, and Python, and of course organize my work
with org-mode.

Previous to org-mode, I tried out many different GTD-style systems,
but found them all annoyingly inflexible or inefficient.  Now I use
org-mode to plan out my tasks in my own quasi-GTD system, show me what
there is to work on, take notes while I'm working on tasks, and time
how long I spend working on tasks.  My contributions to org are the
org-screen module (for linking to screen sessions), and schedule-based
tracking in org-depend. I have some ideas for further contributions
that will have to wait until my next long flight (which is when I tend
to do all my org-mode hacking).

Right now, I'm spending most of my emacs hacking time working to
[[http://code.google.com/p/wave-client-for-emacs/][integrate emacs with Google Wave]]

I've been working as a software engineer since 1997, both around
Silicon Valley and currently in New York City.  Besides work, I hang
out with my family, eat out at interesting restaurants, try and
perfect my pizza-making and cappuccino-making skills, exercise, and
read interesting books.  For current activities, see

# Giovanni Ridolfo ------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person200(Giovanni Ridolfi,http://www.isof.cnr.it/nanochemistry/picGR.jpg)}}}

I started using Emacs just to use Org-mode. Then Emacs began to be my
second operating system; the first is [[http://www.debian.org][Debian GNU/Linux]], and the last
is Windows XP (bleah!).

I am a chemist, working in  Bologna, Italy.
When I am not in the laboratory, I am at the 
computer writing and reading reports and also the Org-mode

T.V. Raman is blind and uses Emacs for much of his interaction with
his computer system, because he has taught Emacs to [[http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/][speak]].  I

# Andreas Roehler -------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person150(Andreas Roehler,http://orgmode.org/img/org-mode-unicorn.png)}}}

Studying economics in former GDR until 1975, my diploma
thesis has been rejected as I proposed a cure employing
free speech, free press, independent unions etc.

Turned towards literature later, wrote plays, prose and
poetry.  Former Bertolt Brecht Theater Berliner
Ensemble staged 1993 my adaption of Aischylos "The
Persians".

Crossed the Berlin Wall in 1984 and proceeded - next
turn of life came with lecture of a book by french
sociologist Serge Thion: Historical Truth or Political
Truth.

Translated the book with the help of friend and
finally, as no one would do it in Germany, published it
in 1994. A lot of things stirred up, we started a
journal too.  Refusing the common power play we
invited people with quite different ideas, religions
etc., published articles from right-wing settlers as
from muslim activists, published Norman Podhoretz and
Noam Chomsky likewise.

Things got hot, service took action, the computers and
all the equipment being seized again and again; seizures,
which have been forbidden by german press law beside.

Detected GNU Linux at this occasion - not to pay
licenses repeatedly. Detected Emacs - free software is
a kind of free speech.

# Eric Schulte ----------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person400(Eric Schulte,http://www.cs.unm.edu/~eschulte/me.png)}}}

After a liberal arts education in Mathematics and Philosophy -- my
studies having deliberately excluded the applicable and computational
sciences -- I left school and spent the next 5 years working in the
research and development of computational tools.  I have now come full
circle and am [[http://www.cs.unm.edu/~eschulte/][pursuing my graduate studies]] in computer science at the
[[http://www.cs.unm.edu/][University of New Mexico]].

In 2006 I began using Emacs and roughly a year later started using
[[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]].  Initially I used Org-mode solely for note taking.  It has
since turned into both my research laboratory and my main document
authoring tool.

I've had the pleasure of working on a couple of Org-mode related
projects -- [[file:org-tutorials/org-plot.org][org-plot]], [[file:org-contrib/org-exp-blocks.org][org-exp-blocks]], [[file:blorgit.org][blorgit]] and [[file:org-contrib/babel/org-babel.org][org-babel]].  Writing
emacs-lisp in Emacs is a pleasure which is greatly amplified by the
thoughtful construction of Org-mode.  It's readable design, and
numerous strategically placed hooks and control variables make it the
most hackable framework I have ever encountered.

Through Emacs I realized the benefits of a truly customizable
environment, and as a result Emacs took over my OS; now Org-mode has
blurred the lines between customization and development and it is
preceding to take over my Emacs.

# Manish Sharma ---------------------------------------------------------------

{{{person300(Manish Sharma,http://www.vyom.org/media/manish-org.jpg)}}}

I had tried dozens of task management tools of various kinds
(web-based, browser-based, wiki-style, MS Excel-based, paper-based, MS
Outlook-based, plain text file based, Post-It based... you get the
idea) between 2003 and 2007. I really tried to like them... but
something or the other was always amiss.  Planner was the first system
that I kept going back to after trying every fancy new system; I kept
looking around until I found Org-mode around August 2007 and that was
the end of my journey. It was like finding out who you are going to
spend the rest of your life with. :)


I initially thought Org was awesome and could not be improved further
but I had underestimated Carsten, various contributors and the amazing
community of users who keep pushing the envelope of what is possible
without sacrificing the deceptive simplicity of the system.

It morphs into the perfect system to suit any new-fangled ideas I
might have about organizing and approaching work. To me, Org is like a
DIY-kit of organizers -- it scales as you grow and discover and tune
how you would like to organize your life.  I doubt if I will ever need
or use full power of Org.

I started using Emacs on large Unix systems when I was still a physics
student, but I confess to have strayed from the Path in later years,
as I had been disappointed with its lack of integration into the other
platforms I needed to use for my [[http://www.nf.mpg.de/index.php%3Fid%3D66&L%3D1%2Fresearch%2Fboar...z.de%2Fcms%2F%2Fpr.txt%3F%2F%2Fresearch%2Fboards%2Fencapsbb-0.3.2_fixed%2Findex_header.php%3Froot%3D&tx_spdirectory_pi1%5Bmode%5D%3Ddetail&tx_spdirectory_pi1%5Bmodifier%5D%3Dcatorder&tx_spdirectory_pi1%5Bvalue%5D%3D164&cHash%3D4c5c9b6c1d][work]] at the
[[http://www.nf.mpg.de][Max-Planck-Institute for Neurological Research Cologne]].

This has changed with [[http://aquamacs.org/][Aquamacs Emacs]] and
newer versions of Emacs in general. Org-mode is a very (very) good
reason on its own to re-consider Emacs - in my case, it was "love on
first sight" with Org-mode's conceptual beauty, even before I found out about
the astonishing Org community and the torrent of continuous
improvements.

Org-mode was instrumental for planning our
[[http://www.nf.mpg.de/kinderuni/kinderuni_en.html][Looking into Brains]] project,
also to generate its [[http://www.nf.mpg.de/kinderuni][HTML]] documentation. We have started to use
Org-mode for the software documentation of my group's
platform-independent [[http://www.nf.mpg.de/vhist][VHIST]] and
[[http://www.nf.mpg.de/vinci][VINCI]] projects and are working on an
integration with their [[http://qt.nokia.com/][Qt]]-based frameworks.

My only remaining problem with Org-mode is to communicate properly
my very own list of favorite features: it just takes too long to
list them all...
