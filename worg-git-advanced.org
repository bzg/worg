This page answers various questions on how to use git for editing Worg.

If you're looking for a quick introduction on how to use git to
contribute to Worg, please read [[file:worg-about.org::#git][this section]] instead.

* Shall I create a branch?

Yes, it's cleaner.

: ~$ git checkout -b t/my-topic-branch 
: ~$ git commit -a -m "A line describing my change"

From here, either you are a registered Worg contributor and want to
merge the branch before pushing to Worg's repo or you just want to
send patches.

If you want to merge the branch and push to Worg:

: ~$ git checkout master
: ~$ git merge t/my-topic-branch
: ~$ git push

If you just want to send patches, see below.

When you're done with a branch, you can delete it with:

: ~$ git branch -D t/my-topic-branch

* I just want to send patches!

It's okay.

You can either prepare patches with [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-format-patch.html][git format-patch]] or send them
directly with [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-email.html][git send-email]].

** Use git format-patch

We suppose you are in a branch called =t/my-topic-branch= and that you
committed your changes.

: ~$ git format-patch origin

will create a separate mbox file for each commit, ready to be sent.

: ~$ git format-patch -3

will create three separate files for the last three commits you did in
this branch.

See the documentation of [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-format-patch.html][git format-patch]] to set the value of the
various headers.

** Use git send-email

If your Worg repo is in =~/git/Worg= and if your emails are sent through
the =send-email= command, please add this to =~/git/Worg/.git/config=:

: [sendemail]
: 	to = bzg AT gnu DOT org

(Replace =AT= and =DOT= by the =@= and =.=)

Then the =git send-email= command will send the patches directly to
Bastien.

Use =git send-email= like this:

: ~$ git send-email --annotate -3

to review and annotate the last three commits in the current branch
before sending them.
