/This page contains what the Org <8.0 manual said about the XOXO export./

/You can use the XOXO export by cloning Org's git repository and checking
out release_7.9.4/

Org mode contains an exporter that produces XOXO-style output.  

Currently, this exporter only handles the general outline structure and
does not interpret any additional Org mode features.

| C-c C-e x   | org-export-as-xoxo | Export as an XOXO file (myfile.org -> myfile.html) |
| C-c C-e v x |                    | Export only the visible part of the document.      |
