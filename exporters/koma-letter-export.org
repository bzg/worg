This tutorial describes the necessary steps to produce beautiful
letters using the Org-mode LaTeX exporter and the KOMA-Script
=scrlttr2= letter class.

* DONE Quick start guide

** DONE Requirements

The code in this tutorial depends on the following:

- org-mode version 8.0 or greater (part of Emacs 24.4);
- a LaTeX installation including [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script][KOMA-Script]], e.g., [[http://www.tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]].

*Note*: The information in this tutorial depends on functionality that
has not yet been released and it not part of Emacs. You can either [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development][use
the latest development version from the Org-mode git repository]] or
[[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/contrib/lisp/ox-koma-letter.el][download a current version of the KOMA-Script letter exporter]] and
install it in your =load-path=, e.g. =contrib/lisp= in the Org-tree or
=~/.emacs.d/lisp=. It is also strongly recommended to read the
comments at the beginning of [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/contrib/lisp/ox-koma-letter.el][the file]] for information or changes that
have not yet been documented here.

** DONE Minimal configuration of the KOMA-Script letter exporter

To use the KOMA-Script letter exporter, you have to add it to Emacs's
load path, activate it, and optionally configure a LaTeX class for the
LaTeX exporter (the KOMA-Script letter exporter uses the LaTeX
exporter internally).

1. Add the path containing =ox-koma-letter.el= to the Emacs
   =load-path=. For example, if you use the version contained in the
   directory =contrib/lisp= of Org-mode, add the following to your
   Emacs configuration:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp")
   #+END_SRC

2. Activate the KOMA-Script letter exporter by adding the following to
   your Emacs configuration:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (eval-after-load 'ox '(require 'ox-koma-letter))
   #+END_SRC

3. <<letter-class-definition>> The KOMA-Script exporter comes with
   minimal latex class =default-koma-letter= that is enabled by
   default.  You may add your own customized class, =my-letter=, as
   follows:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (eval-after-load 'ox-koma-letter
       '(progn
          (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                       '("my-letter"
                         "\\documentclass\{scrlttr2\}
          \\usepackage[english]{babel}
          \\setkomavar{frombank}{(1234)\\,567\\,890}
          \[DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
          \[PACKAGES]
          \[EXTRA]"))

          (setq org-koma-letter-default-class "my-letter")))
   #+END_SRC

   A more complicated example is presented in the commentary section
   of [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/contrib/lisp/ox-koma-letter.el][=ox-koma-script.el=]].

   Note that you may have to add the LaTeX Babel package to you
   preamble, e.g., as
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (eval-after-load 'ox-latex
       '(add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("AUTO" "babel" t) t))
   #+END_SRC

   For more information about this step, refer to the documentation of
   the variables [[https://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-latex-classes][org-latex-classes]], [[https://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-latex-default-packages-alist][org-latex-default-packages-alist]],
   and [[https://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-latex-packages-alist][org-latex-packages-alist]].

** DONE A simple letter example

Printed below is a minimal Org file that can be exported as a
KOMA-Script letter. In this file, press =C-c C-e= to bring up the
exporter dispatcher and then press =k o= to export the Org file to a
PDF file. For your convenience, you can [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/exporters/koma-letter-new-example.org][download the KOMA letter
example]] and you can also [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/exporters/koma-letter-new-example.pdf][download the example PDF letter]].

#+INCLUDE: koma-letter-new-example.org src org

Since no =LaTeX_CLASS= has been specified the default class will be
used.  The first block of lines specify title, subject and date.
=PLACE= specify the closing sentence and the place from which the
letter is send.

The address of the receiver is specified in the [[#special-headings][special heading]]  with
the =:to:= tag.  Note that the headline text is arbitrary and ignored.

The main letter is the first non-special heading[fn:1].  Notice that
the text of this headline also serves as the opening of the letter.
The closing of the letter is set via the closing special heading.
Note that closing statement is the headline title and the signature is
the content.

Finally, the 'backmatter' printed after the signature are defined in
the tree special heading with the tags =ps=, =cc= and =encl=.  With
the =OPTION= =after-closing-order= we can reorder the ordering of the
'backmatter'.  The content of the =after_letter= heading is inserted
after =\end{letter}=.  This is useful executing arbitrary latex
commands.  For instance, we may want to include PDFs via the
[[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages][=pdfpages=]] package.

=ox-koma-letter.el= also supports an alternative syntax that relies
less on headings as illustrated by the example in this [[https://orgmode.org/worg/sources/exporters/koma-letter-example.org][Org-file]] and
the corresponding [[https://orgmode.org/worg/images/ox-koma-letter/koma-letter-example.pdf][pdf]].

When composing new letters it may be useful to start with template
by typing =C-c C-e #= and choosing =koma-letter=.

** TODO Learning more about KOMA-Script Letter
~org-koma-letter.el~ exports a LaTeX document utilizing the ~scrlttr2~
class of KOMA-Script.  The document class is described in great
details in chapter 4 of the [[http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/doc/scrguien.pdf][KOMA-Script manual]].  If you have TeXLive
you can open the manual with the command ~texdoc KOMA-Script~ and with
MiKTeX one might call ~mthelp KOMA-Script~.

Elements such as the address-field is automatically typeset using
user-provided /metadata/, or /variables/, such as address, sender name
etc.  A full list of variables are available in table 4.1 and an
illustration of placement of variables is shown in figure 4.9, both
the in KOMA-Script manual.  A subset of these are supported directly
by ~ox-koma-letter.el~.

Placement of elements is typically defined by a LCO file.  If, for
instance, the ~DIN~ LCO file is loaded, letters are typeset to fit
German DIN envelopes.  See table 4.18 in the KOMA-Script manual for
default classes.

You can customize the look of your letter by writing your own LCO
files and including them with the ~#+LCO:~ keyword.  See [[*Setting
letter metadata in LCO files]].

* DONE Configuration guide

In addition to the actual content a typical letter also contains
additional information, such as the sender's and recipient's
addresses, a date, and so on. From now on we refer to this additional
data as /letter metadata/.

A special group of letter metadata controls the appearance of the
letter, such as the presence of foldmarks or a back address. These are
called /letter options/.

** DONE Setting letter metadata and letter options

Letter metadata can be configured in one of four ways, listed below
from the most specific to the most general:

1. using Org option lines, as show in the [[*A simple letter example][simple letter example]] above,
2. by using separate Org LaTeX classes,
3. by setting Emacs variables, or
4. in a KOMA-Script Letter Class Option file (LCO file).

We cover these in turn.

*** DONE Multiple LaTeX Classes
It is possible to define multiple LaTeX classes for different
types of letters using the method used [[letter-class-definition][above]].  For example one could
add a special Org LaTeX class, say =foo-copr=, for sending letters to
the stakeholders of Foo Corp, that loads the Foo Logo, specifies the
footer and so forth.  The class is then loaded by inserting
=#+LATEX_CLASS: foo-corp=.

*** DONE Setting letter metadata in Org option lines

A simple way to set letter metadata on-the-fly is by using Org option
lines as used in the [[*A simple letter example][simple letter example]] above where we used both
special headings and keywords.

Some letter options are set using an =#+OPTIONS:= line in the same
manner as other [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][Org mode export options]].

A [[#metadata][list of KOMA letter metadata settings]] is provided below.

Metadata set in the file takes the highest priority. Thus, you can set
default letter metadata using Emacs variables or in an LCO file (see
below).  Then, you can tweak your letter options in the file itself.

If you write a letter as a subtree of an Org heading, you must use Org
properties inside a =:PROPERTIES:= drawer and prefix every option
property with the string =EXPORT_=. See the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][chapter Export options in
the Org manual]] for details.

*** DONE Setting letter metadata in Emacs variables

Letter metadata can also be set using Emacs variables, e.g., in your
init-file. For example, the Emacs Lisp snippet below sets the letter's
closing line and the location.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-koma-letter-closing "See you soon,"
        org-koma-letter-from-address "Verona")
#+END_SRC

A [[#settings][list of KOMA letter metadata settings]] is provided below.

*** DONE Setting letter metadata in LCO files

A third way, letter metadata can be set in so-called letter class
option files (LCO files).  LCO files are regular TeX files which are
included in the TeX source of the letter. Consequently, one has access
to the entirety of KOMA-Script options in LCO files and can also
include other LaTeX code.  For more information about LCO files, see
the [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script][KOMA-Script documentation]].

LCO files are set by the =#+LCO: LCO1 LCO2= option line or the Emacs
variable =org-koma-letter-class-option-file=.  KOMA-Script comes with
a variety of pre-made LCO files, such as =DIN= for German letters,
=NF= for French letters, or =UScommercial9= for US-American letters.

Letter metadata set in LCO files overwrites [[*Setting letter metadata in Emacs variables][letter metadata set in
Emacs variables]] but not [[*Setting letter metadata in Org option lines][letter metadata set in the Org file]].

LCO files are convenient as modules that can be loaded to access
particular setups across letters.  Examples include the sender's
address, the first footer and header, banking information, or the
inclusion of a scanned signature.  A particularly useful LaTeX command
is =\ifkomavarempty{KOMAVAR}{TRUE}{FALSE}= that can be used to
condition the printed output depending on whether =KOMAVAR= is set or
not.  See the example under =\setkomavar{frombank}= in the KOMA-Script
manual (currently page 183).

The following LCO file, called =DefaultAddress.lco=, sets the default
address. It can loaded using the Org option line =#+LCO: DefaultAddress=
(without the =.lco= extension).

#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports code
% Default letter configuration file
\ProvidesFile{DefaultAddress.lco}

% Default address
\setkomavar{fromname}{Jane Doe}
\setkomavar{fromaddress}{Some Street 1\\12345 Some City}
\setkomavar{fromemail}{jane.doe@email.com}
\setkomavar{fromphone}{(555) 526-3363}
\setkomavar{signature}{\usekomavar{fromname}}
#+END_SRC

The following LCO file, called =Banking.lco=, configures a footer with
banking information. To load it together with the default address
defined above one can use the Org option line =#+LCO: DefaultAddress
Banking=.

#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports code
  % Banking information configuration file
  \ProvidesFile{Banking.lco}

  % Banking information in the footer
  \setkomavar{frombank}{Jane Doe\\Account number: 12\,345\,678\\Somebank\\Bank code number: 876\,543\,21}
  \setkomavar{firstfoot}{%
    \footnotesize
    \parbox[b]{\linewidth}{\centering\usekomavar{frombank}}}
#+END_SRC

Custom LCO files must be placed in a directory where LaTeX will find
them. On GNU/Linux, this defaults to =~/texmf/tex/latex=. On OS X, use
=~/Library/texmf/tex/latex=.  In TeX Live, these paths can be
configured using the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME ~/some/path
#+END_SRC

You can test whether =foo.lco= is recognized by TeX Live by running
the command =kpsewhich foo.lco=. After adding a file to the TeX Live
path you may have to run =mktexlsr=.

Special headings may be used to input metadata in =ox-koma-letter=
documents.  A special heading is simply a heading with a recognized
tag.  Their usages were illustrated in the [[*A simple letter example][example]] above.  Special
headings tags are defined in the variables
=org-koma-letter-special-tags-in-letter=,
