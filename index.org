# Let say that you like [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and that you like using [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] for
# editing structured files in Emacs.  Then you might want to /share/
# some =.org= files and ask people to edit them with you.  This is
# what *Worg* is [[file:worg-about.org][about]]: collaboratively editing Org files to build a
# knowledge database about =.org= itself (and planning-related stuff.)

Download Worg =.org= files on your machine:

* Introduction to Org-Mode and Worg

[[https://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] is a powerful system for organizing your complex life with
simple plain-text files.  It seamlessly integrates all your notes,
mindmaps, TODO lists, calendar, day planner, and project schedules
into a single system that can be easily searched (e.g. by grep),
encrypted (e.g. by [[http://www.gnupg.org/][GnuPG]]), backed up and synced, imported/exported,
and [[file:org-faq.org::*Org-mode on mobile devices][accessed on the go]] (e.g. on an iPhone or Android smartphone).  It
can even be used for authoring web pages and documents.

Check out some [[file:org-screenshots.org][screenshots of Org-mode]] in action.  See [[file:org-quotes.org][what people
have to say]] about Org-mode, and read a few [[file:org-testimonies/index.org][user stories]]!

Org-mode is distributed as part of the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] text editor and runs
wherever Emacs runs, including on GNU-Linux, Windows, and Mac.
Written by Carsten Dominik, it is currently maintained by Bastien
Guerry and used by many helpful people who, like you, are desperate to
get and stay organized.  You can read more on [[file:org-maintenance.org][how Org-mode is
maintained]].

The page you're reading is part of =Worg=, a section of the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode web
site]] that is written by a volunteer community of Org-mode fans: [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg][Worg
sources are hosted here]].

It includes tutorials, ideas, code snippets, etc., shared to make your
introduction and customization of Org-mode as easy as possible.  Worg
is maintained by a group of [[file:worgers.org][Worg contributors]], and maybe [[file:todo.org][you]].
