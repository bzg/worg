* Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2012
** How Google describes it
Here is how Google describes the goals of the GSoC program:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Google Summer of Code is a program that offers student developers
stipends to write code for various open source projects (see the [[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012][faq]]
for more information).

Google Summer of Code has several goals:

- Create and release open source code for the benefit of all
- Inspire young developers to begin participating in open source development
- Help open source projects identify and bring in new developers and committers
- Provide students the opportunity to do work related to their
  academic pursuits (think "flip bits, not burgers")
- Give students more exposure to real-world software development
  scenarios (e.g., distributed development, software licensing
  questions, mailing-list etiquette)"
#+END_QUOTE

(quoted from the official [[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012][GSoC 2012]] home page)

** Org Mode participates in GSoC 2012
This year, the Org Mode community will apply for the first time
as mentoring organisation for Google's Summer of Code program.

Students will love the opportunity to contribute to a software they
might use on a daily basis anyway. Org Mode is not only one out of
many interesting open-source projects out there, it is a software tool
custom-made for the needs of students (and scientists in general).

They can use Org Mode for organising their life, their studies and
their finances. They can write their research papers with it as well
as publish their website. Not to mention their spreadsheet
calculations and their (literate) programming work in some 30 Org
Babel languages. And they can do all this with the unsurpassed
efficiency only offered by the combination of Emacs & Org Mode.

Working on an Org Mode project this summer not only will make the
students better (Emacs) Lisp programmers, it will make them better
students too, since skilled Elisp programmers are Emacs power users by
definition and can make the most out of their exceptionally powerfull
software tool.

The students will have the exciting opportunity to join one of the
most dynamic open-source projects today with a big, active, skilled
and very helpfull community. Since the Org Mode project is in such a
dynamic momentum, there are plenty of usefull ideas for student
projects around. In fact, some long desired features for Org Mode
might finally be realized through students projects during the
GSoC 2012.

** Mentors, students and ideas
Org Mode contributers that are not students anymore, but would like to
see some of their ideas with regards to Org Mode come true, are
invited to post these ideas on the [[file:orgmode-gsoc2012-ideas.org][ideas page]] and apply as mentors.
Students are encouraged to either apply for one of the proposed
projects on the ideas page or submit their own ideas and ask one of
the experienced Org Mode contributors if he would like to mentor their
project.

** Info pages
Although all related information can be found on the [[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012][GSoC 2012]] home
page, we prepared an [[file:orgmode-gsoc2012-admin.org][admin page]], a [[file:orgmode-gsoc2012-mentor.org][mentor page]] and a [[file:orgmode-gsoc2012-student.org][student page]] that
only gives the information relevant for the respective group. Remember
that these pages only serve for a quick overview. The complete,
up-to-date and authorized information can be found on the original
[[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012][GSoC 2012]] home page.

The most important page is the [[file:orgmode-gsoc2012-ideas.org][ideas page]]. Since the application
process is a two step process, first the organisation (Org), then the
students, all student projects depend on the successfull application
of the mentoring organisation.

Therefore we should try to build a nice ideas page, grouping the
proposals by topics, with a description for each idea. It
would be nice to associate each idea with a mentor too.

** Student projects

These are the student-projects for the GSoC 2012:

*** Bugpile (failed)

The Bugpile project was aiming at implementing a bug tracker for GNU Emacs
Org-mode based on Org-mode itself.  The project was stopped after the
student didn't pass the mid-term evaluation.

The documentation produced during the project can be obtained by checking
out the "bugpile" repo:

: git clone https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/bugpile

*** Git-Merge-Tool

A specialised [[file:student-projects/git-merge-tool/index.org][git-merge-tool]] for GNU Emacs Org-mode files.

*** Org-sync

[[file:https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/gsoc2012/student-projects/org-sync/][A new mode]] to synchronize Org-mode documents with TODO/bugtracker web
services.
