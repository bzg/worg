* Org Mode GSoC 2012 Ideas Page
** Real webprogramming with Org Mode and PicoLisp
*Project Description:*
[[http://picolisp.com/5000/!wiki?home][PicoLisp]] is one out of many [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html][Org Babel languages]], but may be special in
the sense that it does not only contribute to the static
webpublishing capacities, but may introduce dynamic webprogramming on
top of a real database into Org Mode. 

Real interactive webprogramming frequently involves a (SQL) database
like MySQL, a programming language like PHP or Python to build a MVC
(Model-View-Controller) application on top of the database, a web
framework for that programming language to make the programmers life
easier (e.g. Django for Python), and a persistence layer that abstract
away the conceptual mismatch between the SQL database and the (mostly)
object-oriented application. Sometimes, a WYSIWYG html editor like MS
Frontpage is invovled too, when webdesigners design the UI of the
application. 

Such an application needs user input (via <form> or <input> elements
in the html pages) and needs to adapt dynamically to the users actions
and queries by updating either the whole page or only parts of it
(Javascript). For each user, a session is needed to keep track of the
state of the application during his/her visit. 

This kind of dynamic webprogramming can't be done with Org Mode.
Typical webpages made with Org Mode are static in nature, even if they
update their content frequently with some cron jobs on the server.
There is no interaction with the user. 

Considering the web stack for dynamic web apps described
above, Org Mode really functions as a kind of 'Frontpage on steroids'
for highly skilled academics. The project idea is to let PicoLisp
replace all the other elements of the webstack and combine Org Mode
and PicoLisp into an entirely Lisp-based framework for dynamic web
programming. 

In the PicoLisp application framework, UI and database are unified.
Database objects are first class members of the language, and the UI
elements act directly on this object-oriented lisp database (that is
fast and scalable). No external SQL storage is needed, no persistence
layer between the relational world of the DB and the object-oriented
world of the application, and no glue code (controller) that connects
the view to the model. 

By merging PicoLisp's framework for rapid web-application development
with Org Modes framework for rapid (web-) content production via Org
Babel, new kinds of websites produced with Org Mode should become
possible.

*Difficulty:*
Medium

*Requirements:*
Elisp, PicoLisp

*Recommended:* 
Knowledge about the inner workings of Org-babel and the
PicoLisp application programming framework, some experience with Git.

*Mentors:*
Bastien Guerry, Eric Schulte

** Git merge tool for Org files
*Project Description:*
This project idea is about writing a git merge driver for Org mode
files, in the way [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p%3Dgnulib.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3Dlib/git-merge-changelog.c][git-merge-changelog]] does this for GNU style
ChangeLog files?

One of the obstacle for using Org-mode for collaborative programs is
that many operations add or remove text from the beginning or end of a
file, or which add or remove a subnode from an outline tree. These are
operations that confuse the git merger, in particular if two people
have added something to a file, or removed/added sequential sibling
nodes.

I believe that this could be solved with a dedicated merge driver that
understands the integrity of an outline (sub)tree, and that knows that
the sequence of two new subtrees added by different people does not
matter.

The idea for this is actually (I believe) from Brian Gough who asked
me about it at FOSDEM. I have now also run into this problem and would
really find it great if such a merge driver could be written. 

*Difficulty:*
Hard

*Requirements:*
Git, Elisp, C

*Recommended:* 
Good understanding of Git and the structure of Org-mode files.

** Implement an Elisp backend for Ragel 
*Project Description:*
Ragel http://www.complang.org/ragel/ is a tool
that integrates regular expressions and state machines under one
umbrella. It has backends currently for C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java
and Ruby. Programming an Elisp backend would be a manageable task for
a GSoC project.

After that org-mode code might become half as long and twice as
fast - at least those sections that are heavily regex oriented.

*Difficulty:*
Medium

*Requirements:*
Elisp, RegExp

*Recommended:* 
Familiarity with Org-mode, regular expressions and state machines.

*Mentors:*
Bastien Guerry, Rustom Mody, Nicolas Goaziou


** "Notebook" like console interface on top of Org Mode/ Babel
*Project Description:*
Implementing a multi-programming-language "notebook" like console
interface build on top of Org-mode and Babel (with both Emacs and
HTML interfaces).

*Difficulty:*
Medium

*Requirements:*
Elisp, HTML

*Recommended:* 
Familiarity with Org-mode and Babel

*Mentors:*

** Asynchronous code block execution for Org Babel
*Project Description:*
Adding support for asynchronous code block execution.

*Difficulty:*
Medium

*Requirements:*
Elisp, C

*Recommended:* 
Good understanding of Org Babel and the GNU/Linux process model.

*Mentors:*
Eric Schulte

** Piping results between Babel code blocks
*Project Description:*
Adding support for piping results between code blocks allowing many
blocks to run concurrently (probably best combined with asynchronous
execution).

*Difficulty:*
Medium

*Requirements:*
Elisp, C

*Recommended:* 
Good understanding of Org Babel and the GNU/Linux process model.

*Mentors:*
Eric Schulte

** Handling Babel code block output written to STDERR
*Project Description:*
Adding support for handling output written to STDERR.

*Difficulty:*
Medium

*Requirements:*
Elisp

*Recommended:* 
Familiarity with Org Babel and GNU/Linux.
