Note: everything here is a work in progress.

* Workflow/Roadmap

** First import

- the user runs =os-import=, and is prompted for a repo url
- org-sync tries to match it against per-backend pattern in order to
  chose the right one.
- org-sync inserts a new headline named "Bugs of /repo/" or prompts
  the user for a name. The headline name is not stored remotely and
  can be changed to anything.
- this headline has a set of well defined PROPERTIES used by every
  backend and (optionally) other for a specific backend.
- This headlines contains sub-headlines, one for each bug.
- Again, each bug headline has a set of PROPERTIES common to every
  backend and some for a specific one.

** Synchronization

- the user runs =os-sync= which syncs each buglist in the buffer.
- if the document doesn't have any buglist, inform the user to call
  =os-import= (or call it directly).
- org-sync fetches the buglist, and adds any new bugs to the
  right buglist.
- conflicting changes are handled by showing the new and the old entries in a
  distinctive manner. The user deletes the one he doesn't want.
- org-sync sends the resulting merge to the remote bugtracker.

** Shared properties

After looking at each web service, I came up with the following set of
properties.

*** Buglist

- title
- source-url

*** Bug

- id
- status
- title
- description
- creation-date
- update-date
- deadline
- priority
- tags
- author
- assignee

* Bugtrackers

Here are useful information about planned backends. I won't list
detailed information about properties that don't fit in the project.

** Bugzilla

Bugzilla is a full-featured bugtracker written in Perl. There is a
XML-RPC and a JSON-RPC interface which Org-sync can use.

Since the JSON-RPC interface was added fairly recently in Bugzilla
(v3.6 released April 13, 2010), we should focus on the XML one.

- [[http://www.bugzilla.org][Bugzilla website]]
- [[http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.2/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService.html][XML-RPC API]]
- [[https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip-sqlite/page.cgi?id=fields.html][Bug fields in default install]]

*** Relevent bug properties

- id: simple unsigned number
- status: there are multiple status but they all fall in the
  open/closed categories. [[https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip-sqlite/page.cgi?id=fields.html#status][Status definition in default install]].
  - Open: unconfirmed, confirmed, in_progress, ...
  - Closed: resolved, verified, fixed, invalid, wontfix, duplicate,
    worksforme, ...
- classification & component: bugs are categorised into Classifications,
  Products and Components. classifications is the top-level
  categorisation.
- creation date
- update date
- severity
- priority to fix
- summary: short description, aka title
- description
- milestone: simple string

** GitHub

GitHub hosts open source projects and provides git repositories along
with other things, notably a wiki and a bugtracker (GitHub Issues).

GitHub also provides a REST API for their bugtracker. The output format is JSON.

- [[http://github.com][GitHub website]]
- [[http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/][Bugtracker REST API]]

*** Relevant bug properties

- id: simple unsigned number.
- title
- author
- description: can be fetched in various format.
- state: open or closed.
- creation date
- update date
- labels: each bug can be tagged with multiple strings ex: bug,
  wontfix, etc.
- milestone: each bug can be assigned to one milestone.
- assignee: each bug can be assigned to one person.

A milestone has:
- id
- title
- description
- number of open/closed issues.
- deadline

** Redmine

Redmine is a project management web application written in Ruby. It
has a REST API in both JSON and XML.

- [[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine][Redmine website]]
- [[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api][REST API]]

*** Relevant bug properties

- id: simple unsigned number
- status: can be arbitrary string. [[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineIssueTrackingSetup][Default ones]]:
  - Closed: Closed, Rejected
  - Open: everything else
- tracker: simple string. Top-level categorisation. ex: bug, feature,
  support, task, ...
- category: second-level categorisation (can be empty).
- author
- creation date
- update date
- deadline
- priority
- assignee
- title
- description

** Google Code

Google has its own open source project hoster. It provides a
bugtracker. I didn't find any API for it but each the bug list can be
exported to CSV.

- [[http://code.google.com/][Google Code website]]
- [[http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/csv][Sample project CSV export]]

** Bitbucket

Bitbucket provides free public/private git/mercurial repository, along
with a wiki, issue tracker, etc.

There's a REST API in JSON.

- [[http://bitbucket.org][Bitbucket website]]
- [[http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Using+the+bitbucket+REST+APIs][REST API]]

** Relevant bug properties

- id: simple unsigned number
- status: fixed number of status
  - Open: open, new
  - Closed: resolved, on hold, duplicate, wontfix, invalid
- type: category, fixed string: bug, enhancement, proposal, task
- priority: fixed string: trivial, minor, major, critical, blocker
- component: category, string
- version: category, string
- milestone: category, string
- author
- creation date
- update date
- title

* TO-DO list manager

** Toodledo

Toodledo is yet another webservice to organize tasks. It features
TO-DO list, folders, calendars and more.

Toodledo has a REST API specifically designed for syncing. The output
format can be JSON or XML.

- [[https://www.toodledo.com/index.php][Toodledo website]]
- [[http://api.toodledo.com/2/tasks/index.php][REST API]]

** Google Task

Google also has its own task manager. It's more simple and
straightforward than Toodledo: TODO-list and dates.

There's a REST API in JSON.

- [[http://mail.google.com/mail/help/tasks/][Google Tasks website]]
- [[https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/v1/reference/][REST API]]
