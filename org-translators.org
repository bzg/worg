This page lists the various conversion tools that have been written to
export Org-mode data and import external data into the Org-mode system.

* Org-mode Export Tools

The tools listed here do take Org-mode files and convert them to a different format:

** [[https://www.drupal.org/node/1977240][From Org-mode to Drupal]] by [[file:users/davidam.org][David Arroyo Men√©ndez]].

** From Org-mode to Freemind

... by Marco Vezzoli, this is available in the contrib directory of the distribution.

** From Org-mode to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar][ICal]]endar applications

- there are an export tool already implemented in org mode, is
  [[https://orgmode.org/manual/iCalendar-export.html#iCalendar-export][explained at the org manual]].

- For Google users, read [[file:org-tutorials/org-google-sync.org][this tutorial]].

** [[https://github.com/zzamboni/ox-leanpub][ox-leanpub: Org-mode exporter for Leanpub books]]

* Org-mode Import Tools

The tools listed here do take non-Org-mode files and convert them to Org:

** [[http://www.olafdietsche.de/palm/palm2orgmode.pl][From Palm TODO database to Orgmode]]

This Translator was written by [[http://www.olafdietsche.de/][Olaf Dietsche]].

** From [[https://list.orgmode.org/20080112175502.0fb06b66@linux.site][Remind to Org]] by Detlef Steuer

** From [[http://bitbucket.org/legoscia/of2org][OmniFocus to Org]] by Magnus Henoch

** From [[http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper][TaskPaper]] to Org by Carsten Dominik

A quite complete translation can be achieved by a compact Perl program:

 #+begin_src perl
   #!/usr/bin/perl
   /^(\t*)-(.*?)((@\w+ *)*)$/;
   @u=grep{$_ ne'@done'}(@t=split/ +/,$3);
   @v=@u?('',@u,''):();
   $t{$_}++for@u;
   $_="*"x(2+length$1).(@t==@u?" TODO":" DONE").$2.join(":",@v)."\n"if$&;
   s/^\w.*:\s*$/* $&/;
   END{printf "* Setup\n#+TAGS: %s\n",join' ',keys%t}
 #+end_src

 This program is quite unreadable because it resulted from a
 [[https://list.orgmode.org/0277B507-1486-4172-B1C6-1B73B84148DD@science.uva.nl][contest for the most compact translator]] - but it works very well
 anyway.

** From [[https://bitbucket.org/josemaria.alkala/odt2org/wiki/Home][ODT to Org]], by Jose Maria Alkala

** From ICalendar to Org

There are some tools and documentation related:

- There is a mention of some tools at the [[file:org-tools/index.org][org-tools]] section, [[file:org-tools/index.org::*ical2org.awk - convert ics files to Org][here]].

- For Google users, see [[file:org-tutorials/org-google-sync.org::*From Google Calendar into org using .ics files][this]].

- For a command line tool that converts files, URLs (e.g., Google
  Calendar), email attachments, and other sources into org-mode
  events, see [[https://github.com/rjhorniii/ical2org][this]].  It can integrate with crontab, systemd,
  etc. for automatic updating.  An example of [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] integration for
  processing email attachments with ics content is shown.

** From Microsoft Exchange to Org

- Bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/novoid/exchange2org/issues
- State of development: 2023-04-09 worked for many years but author isn't using Exchange after 2019.

This tool was very handy for getting Exchange-based appointments into
my Org-mode agenda. Not used after 2019 so it might need some
maintenance.

** From Altlassian Jira to Org

*** jira2org-story.py - Extract Jira Issues and Generate Org-mode Headings

- Technology: Python 3
- Bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/novoid/jira2org-story.py/issues
- State of development: 2023-04-09 stable.

The script is accessing the API of Altlassian's Jira to generate
[[https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/README.org][Orgdown]] content. The author is using it to extract whole epics from
Jira and create more detailed workflows within Org-mode.

This principle can be adapted to all sorts of use-cases. The author is
using multiple variations of this script for specific workflows.

** Memacs - Collecting data from all sorts of external data sources

- License: GPL 3.0
- Technology: Python 3
- Bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/novoid/Memacs/issues
- State of development: 2023-04-09 some modules were written and used
  by the author. Most modules are contributions from other users of
  Memacs.

If you want to (re-)collect your own data from various sources such as
text messages, visited web pages, photographs, emails, git commits and
so forth, this framework allows for using or writing modules that
convert non-[[https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/README.org][Orgdown]] formats to Orgdown. This way, you get a really
detailed agenda with all of your activities.

* Org-mode to Org-mode

Sometimes, people write software outside of Elisp that has Org-mode files as input as well as output:

** orgdepend_to_orgedna - Tool for the transition from [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-depend.html][org-depend]] to [[https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/][org-edna]]

- License: GPL 3.0
- Technology: Python 3
- Bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/novoid/orgdepend_to_orgedna/issues
- State of development: 2023-04-09 used by the author to convert his setup once. Might need maintenance with newer versions.

Most use-cases for org-depend can be migrated to org-edna using that
tool. Please refer to the documentation to learn what can be converted
and what not.
