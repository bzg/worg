This page lists the various conversion tools that have been written to
export Org-mode data and import external data into the Org-mode system.

* Org-mode Export Tools

  - [[https://www.drupal.org/node/1977240][From Org-mode to Drupal]] by [[file:users/davidam.org][David Arroyo Menéndez]].

  - From Org-mode to Freemind by Marco Vezzoli, this is available in
    the contrib directory of the distribution.

  - From Org-mode to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar][ICal]]endar applications:

    - there are an export tool already implemented in org mode, is
      [[https://orgmode.org/manual/iCalendar-export.html#iCalendar-export][explained at the org manual]].

    - For Google users, read [[file:org-tutorials/org-google-sync.org][this tutorial]].

* Org-mode Import Tools

  - [[http://www.olafdietsche.de/palm/palm2orgmode.pl][From Palm TODO database to Orgmode]].  This Translator was
    written by [[http://www.olafdietsche.de/][Olaf Dietsche]].

  - From [[https://orgmode.org/list/20080112175502.0fb06b66@linux.site][Remind to Org]] by Detlef Steuer.

  - From [[http://bitbucket.org/legoscia/of2org][OmniFocus to Org]] by Magnus Henoch.

  - From [[http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper][TaskPaper]] to Org by Carsten Dominik.  A quite complete
    translation can be achieved by a compact Perl program:

    #+begin_src perl
      #!/usr/bin/perl
      /^(\t*)-(.*?)((@\w+ *)*)$/;
      @u=grep{$_ ne'@done'}(@t=split/ +/,$3);
      @v=@u?('',@u,''):();
      $t{$_}++for@u;
      $_="*"x(2+length$1).(@t==@u?" TODO":" DONE").$2.join(":",@v)."\n"if$&;
      s/^\w.*:\s*$/* $&/;
      END{printf "* Setup\n#+TAGS: %s\n",join' ',keys%t}
    #+end_src

    This program is quite unreadable because it resulted from a
    [[https://orgmode.org/list/0277B507-1486-4172-B1C6-1B73B84148DD@science.uva.nl][contest for the most compact translator]] - but it works very well
    anyway.

  - From [[https://bitbucket.org/josemaria.alkala/odt2org/wiki/Home][ODT to Org]], by Jose Maria Alkala.

  - From ICalendar to Org. There are some tools and documentation related:

    - There is a mention of some tools at the [[file:org-tools/index.org][org-tools]] section, [[file:org-tools/index.org::*ical2org.awk%20-%20convert%20ics%20files%20to%20Org][here]].

    - For Google users, see [[file:org-tutorials/org-google-sync.org::*From%20Google%20Calendar%20into%20org%20using%20.ics%20files][this]].

    - For a command line tool that converts files, URLs (e.g., Google
      Calendar), email attachments, and other sources into org-mode
      events, see [[https://github.com/rjhorniii/ical2org][this]].  It can integrate with crontab, systemd,
      etc. for automatic updating.  An example of [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] integration for
      processing email attachments with ics content is shown.

* Bi-directional
