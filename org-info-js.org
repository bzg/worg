* org-info-js by Sebastian Rose

org-info-js is a great javascript tool to navigate through a HTML page
(as exported by Org) the way you navigate through an Org or an info
manual, i.e. supporting folding, previous/next buttons, etc.

** org-info-js as powerpoint

It was [[http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-orgmode@gnu.org/msg07820.html][noticed]] that files exported by org-info-js were similar to [[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][s5]]
the simple standards-based Slide Show System.  After some hacking,
Sebastian Rose added some features to allow org-mode and org-info-js
to be used to create simple slide shows and presentations.

An example org-info-js presentation can be found [[file:code/org-info-js/org-slides/slides.html][here]]

*** SUGGESTION #+TITLE's shouldn't display on every slide by default

The title for each slide should (by default) be the slides heading.

*** SUGGESTION Name for org-info-js slide show extension(s)

Some suggested names for this functionality.

- org-present
- org-point
- org-note (as in keynote)
- present-org

*** SUGGESTION Use properties to reveal bullet points

To have bullet points reveal themselves one by one in org-info-js you
need to replicate the slide many times, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Overview

  + The first point

,* Overview

  + The first point
  + The second point revealed

,* Overview

  + The first point
  + The second point revealed
  + The third point (note the duplication of the slide)
#+END_SRC

Rather than this, we might (assuming properties can be exported) be
able to support a syntax like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Overview
  :PROPERTIES:
  :reveal:   t
  :END:

  + Revealed properties
  + Appear one after the other
  + But this time only need to be stated once!
#+END_SRC
