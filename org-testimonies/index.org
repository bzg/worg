: The following document describes how to use Carsten Dominik’s excellent
: org-mode Emacs package after the fashion of a pen-and-paper day planner.
: 
: For those curious, I was not brought up on time management in the era of
: the current GTD fad. I started with a hard-bound book filled with daily
: planning sheets, along with training and books supporting this method. I
: found it incredibly useful for the three or so years that I stuck with
: it, but ultimately discovered that only digital media can truly keep up
: with my ever-changing world. Thus began my quest for the ultimate,
: computer day planning package.

: I spend most of my day working on or near a computer:  writing, replying
: to e-mail, making phone calls, and so on. I use Lotus Notes for my
: calendar because people need to be able to check my availability for
: meetings. I use Emacs to keep track of what I need to do, because it
: makes planning my day so much easier.
