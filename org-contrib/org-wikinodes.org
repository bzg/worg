* Introduction

/org-wikinodes.el/ implements CamelCase wiki-like links in Org mode.
However, while most wiki implementations use files as the basic data
unit, it is more natural for Org to use outline nodes.

/org-wikinodes.el/ turns CamelCase words into links to CamelCase
headlines and creates missing headlines if necessary.

* Installation

Like with most contribued modules, just customize the variable
=org-modules= and select the line for /org-wikinodes/.

If you want to use this module only in some files/directories but not
in others, set your general preference in the variable
=org-wikinodes-active= and then use Emacs [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html][file variables]] or
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html][directory-local variables]] to change things where necessary.

* How to use this module

When this package is activated, any headlines that consist of only a
single CamelCase word, optionally with a TODO keyword, a priority
cookie and tags, are treated as a wiki node.

#+begin_src org
,* TODO [#C] ThisIsAWikiNodeInOrgMode    :test:
#+end_src

Writing the CamelCase word plainly in the text will create a link to
that node.

Following the link will jump to it, and you can return to the previous
position with =C-c &=.  If the target does not exist, it can be
created.  By default the user will be asked if the target should be
created, but the exact behavior can be modified using the user option
=org-wikinodes-create-targets=.

* Wiki links across files

By default a match for a link is only attempted in the current file.
However, you can make Org consider headlines in all org files in the
same directory by setting

: (setq org-wikinodes-scope 'directory)

In this case, to speed things up, a cache is created that remembers in
which file a particular node can be found.  The cache is updated
directly if you create nodes automatically by following CamelCase
links to non-existing headlines.  However, if you create a new node by
hand (just typing it), then you need to clear the cache before the
node can be found from a link in a different file.  To clear the
cache, press =C-c C-c= in any headline that is just a CamelCase word.

* Export and publishing

/org-wikinodes.el/ fully supports export and publishing.  Links will
be functional in the published version of the files.

* CamelCase words are hard to read

Yes, this is true.  If you find this problematic, try =glasses-mode=
which makes =CamelCase= words more readable by displaying them like
=Camel_Case=.
