#+TITLE: Verify an Org-mode environment
#+OPTIONS: num:nil ^:nil
#+LaTeX_CLASS: normal
#+STARTUP: hideblocks
#+TODO: TODO | DONE

Check an Org-mode environment.

*warning*: executing the table in this buffer will execute elisp and
 shell commands on your system.  These commands are intended to check
 aspects of your environment for compatibility with Org-mode, however
 malicious people could tie arbitrary and/or malicious code blocks to
 this table.
 - don't be malicious, only put reasonable code into this buffer
 - don't be angry, you've been warned about the possible risks of
   using this buffer

 In general Org-moders are very nice and will most likely keep this
 buffer both safe and useful.

* Instructions
  - Download the file [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/examples/org-check.org][org-check.org]]
  - Calculate the table by putting point in the table and pressing =C-u C-c *=
  - Check the =results= column
    - if you see all "pass" results, then your environment passes
    - if you see "fail" or other unexpected results, then follow the
      link in the =topic= column for an explanation

#+TBLFM:

* Tasks
** Org Setup
   - It is sometimes the case that updating Org-mode seems to have no
     effect.  This can arise when there are multiple Org-mode
     installations, or if Org-mode was compiled and then not
     recompiled after an update.
*** Org library
    - This is where emacs is finding the Org-mode installation
*** Org version
    - This is the hard-coded version number from org.el.
** Export LaTeX

   - [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.html][LaTeX Export Tutorial]]

*** Check =org-export-latex-classes=

    - Check that the variable =org-export-latex-classes= has been set: [[elisp:(progn (describe-variable 'org-export-latex-classes) (other-window 1))]] 

** Preview LaTeX
   - Previewing LaTeX in the Org-mode buffer requires:
     - a working LaTeX installation, including the =latex= executable
     - the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/][dvipng]] executable
     - paths to these executables on =exec-path=
   - If either latex-system or dvipng-system fails, then you probably
     need to install software
   - If latex-system passes and latex fails, then you need to modify
     the variable =exec-path=, so the path to the latex executable is
     included
   - If dvipng-system passes and dvipng fails, then you need to modify
     the variable =exec-path=, so the path to the dvipng executable is
     included
   - Image size can be scaled using the =:scale= property of the
     variable =org-format-latex-options=
** Make pdf files
   - Pdf files are created for in-buffer preview and as the
     end-product of [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.html#sec-7][LaTeX export]]
** Agenda
   - The [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html#Agenda-Views][agenda]] is key to using Org-mode effectively
** Babel
   - [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/index.php][Org-babel]] extends the very excellent Org-mode with the ability to
     execute code blocks
   - [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.php#getting-started][Org-babel configuration]] is a 5-step process that requires entries
     in =.emacs=
*** Org-babel provided
    - If this test fails, then Org-babel isn't loaded
    - You probably need something like this in =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-init)
#+end_src
    - [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.php#getting-started][Org-babel installation]] is a 5-step process

*** R language configuration
    - [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-R)
#+end_src
    - if =chk-ext-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check if there
      is a path to the R executable in =exec-path= : [[elisp:(progn (describe-variable 'exec-path) (other-window))]] and possibly add a line to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/path/to/R/executable")))
#+end_src
    - if =chk-sys-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check to see if
      R is installed on your system
*** C language configuration
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29][C]] is a general-purpose computer programming language
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-C)
#+end_src
    - if =chk-ext-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check if there
      is a path to the cc executable in [[elisp:(progn%20(describe-variable%20'exec-path)%20(other-window%201))][exec-path]] and possibly add a
      line to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/path/to/cc/executable")))
#+end_src
    - if =chk-sys-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check to see if
      a C compiler is installed on your system and, if it is, what it
      is called other than =cc=
*** Clojure language configuration
    - [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]] is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-clojure)
#+end_src

*** Ditaa language configuration
    - [[http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/][Ditaa]] is a small command-line utility written in Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art into proper bitmap graphics
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-ditaa)
#+end_src

*** CSS configuration
    - [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/][Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)]] is a simple mechanism for adding style to Web documents
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to =.emacs=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-css)
#+end_src

*** Gnuplot language configuration
    - [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][Gnuplot]] is a command-line driven graphing utility
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to .emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-babel-gnuplot)
#+end_src
    - if =chk-ext-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check if there
      is a path to the gnuplot executable in [[elisp:(progn%20(describe-variable%20'exec-path)%20(other-window%201))][exec-path]] and possibly add a
      line to .emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/path/to/gnuplot/executable")))
#+end_src
    - if =chk-sys-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check to see if
      gnuplot is installed on your system

*** LaTeX language configuration
    - [[http://www.tug.org/][LaTeX]] is a TeX macro package that provides a document processing system
    - if =chk-babel-lang= returns =fail= then you should add this line
      to .emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      line to .emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/path/to/latex/executable")))
#+end_src
    - if =chk-sys-cmd= returns =fail= then you should check to see if
