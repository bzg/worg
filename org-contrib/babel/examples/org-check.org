#+TITLE: Verify an Org-mode environment

#+LaTeX_CLASS: normal
#+STARTUP: hideblocks
#+TODO: TODO | DONE

Check an Org-mode environment.

*warning*: executing the table in this buffer will execute elisp and
 shell commands on your system.  These commands are intended to check
 aspects of your environment for compatibility with Org-mode, however
 malicious people could tie arbitrary and/or malicious code blocks to
 this table.
 - don't be malicious, only put reasonable code into this buffer
 - don't be angry, you've been warned about the possible risks of
   using this buffer
   
 In general Org-moders are very nice and will most likely keep this
 buffer both safe and useful.

* Instructions
  - Download the file [[http://org-babel.tsdye2.com/org-check.org][org-check.org]]
  - Calculate the table by putting point in the table and pressing =C-u C-c *=
  - Check the =results= column
    - if you see all "pass" results, then your environment passes
    - if you see "fail" or other unexpected results, then follow the
      link in the =topic= column for an explanation

* Tasks
** Org Setup
   - It is sometimes the case that updating Org-mode seems to have no
     effect.  This can arise when there are multiple Org-mode
     installations, or if Org-mode was compiled and then not
     recompiled after an update. 
*** Org library
    - This is where emacs is finding the Org-mode installation
*** Org version
    - This is the hard-coded version number from org.el.
** Export LaTeX
   - [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.php][LaTeX Export Tutorial]]
*** Check =org-export-latex-classes=
    - Check that the variable [[elisp:(progn (describe-variable 'org-export-latex-classes) (other-window 1))][org-export-latex-classes]] has been set

** Preview LaTeX
   - Previewing LaTeX in the Org-mode buffer requires: 
     - a working LaTeX installation, including the =latex= executable
     - the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/][dvipng]] executable
     - paths to these executables on =exec-path=
   - If either latex-system or dvipng-system fails, then you probably
     need to install software
   - If latex-system passes and latex fails, then you need to modify
     the variable =exec-path=, so the path to the latex executable is
     included 
   - If dvipng-system passes and dvipng fails, then you need to modify
     the variable =exec-path=, so the path to the dvipng executable is
     included 
   - Image size can be scaled using the =:scale= property of the
     variable =org-format-latex-options=
