Babel supports a growing number of programming languages; more than
ten dozen languages currently have some Babel support.  Babel support
for more than three dozen widely used languages is distributed with
Emacs, and the various [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][Emacs Lisp Package Archives]] include support for
more than four dozen languages.  In addition, for various historical
reasons, Babel support for more than two dozen languages is
distributed in the [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib][Org-contrib package]].

This page provides pointers to sources of Babel language support,
instructions to activate a supported language, and a brief guide to
developing support for a language in case you'd like to use a new
language with Babel or contribute to existing Babel language support.

** Language Support Distributed with Emacs
Table [[babel-languages]] lists the Babel language support distributed
with Emacs. The table provides a link to a web page with information
about the language, indicates how the language is identified in Babel,
provides a link to existing documentation, and indicates the
generosity of your colleagues who have volunteered to maintain a bit
of Babel language support.

If you would like to maintain a Babel language support file, then
please review [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-maintenance.html][how Org is maintained]] and send an email to the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-mailing-list.html][mailing
list]].

Note that there are some [[file:lang-compat.org][inconsistencies among supported languages]].

** Language Support Distributed with Org-contrib
Once upon a time, Babel language support that was not released under
the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPL]] was kept in [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib][Org-contrib]].  Later, with the goal of easing the
burden of Org-mode maintenance, lesser-known languages distributed
with Emacs were also moved to [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib][Org-contrib]].  Table
[[contributed-languages]] includes pointers to these languages and some
documentation of their Babel integration.

** Language Support Distributed via an Emacs Lisp Package Archive

Most language support is distributed through an [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][Emacs Lisp Package
Archive]]. You can find the Babel language support available on your
setup with =M-x list-packages=.  In theory, it ought to be possible to
identify all the Babel language support packages with a keyword search
using =M-x package-menu-filter=, but this method is unreliable because
package developers do not subscribe to a keyword authority list.  In
practice, you can search for package names that start with =ob-= and
go from there.

* Activate a Language
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: configure
  :END:

To add support for a particular language to your Babel installation
first make sure that the requirements of the language are met, then
customize the =org-babel-load-languages= variable with the appropriate language identifier, <lang>, from Table [[babel-languages]] or Table [[contributed-languages]], as follows:

: (<lang> . t)

To /remove/ support for a language, customize the =org-babel-load-languages= variable, as follows:

: (<lang> . nil)

Here is an example manual configuration of this variable, which
enables support for =R=, and disables support for =emacs-lisp=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
;; active Babel languages
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((R . t)
   (emacs-lisp . nil)))
#+end_src

* Develop Support for a Language
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: develop
  :END:

The core Babel functions (viewing, export, tangling, etc.) are
language agnostic and will work even for languages that are not
explicitly supported.  Explicit language-specific support is required
only for evaluation of code blocks in a language.

Babel is designed to be easily extended to support new languages.
Language support is added by defining language-specific functions
using a simple naming convention.  The full suite of possible language
specific functions need not be implemented all at once, but rather it
is possible (and encouraged) to develop language-specific
functionality in an incremental fashion---Babel will make use of
those functions which are available, and will fail gracefully when
functionality has not yet been implemented.

There is a short Emacs Lisp template ([[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg/tree/master/item/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el][ob-template.el]]) which can be
used as a starting point for implementing support for new languages.
To fetch a copy of this file, please clone Worg:

#+begin_example
 ~$ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg
#+end_example

You should find =org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el=.

Developers are encouraged to read the [[file:../../org-contribute.org][Org-mode contribution
instructions]] in the hope that the language support can be added to the
Org-mode core.

** Some additional comments/development tips

Although most of the instructions in =ob-template.el= should be
useful, and explain clearly how to use the code, some explanations for
more advanced functionalities could be a little outdated
(contributions are very welcome. The thread [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-09/msg00487.html][here]] may contain some
extra useful information, although most of the suggestions provided by
Eric should have been implemented). If some of the instructions seem
clear, then here are some suggestions to gain clarity:

- start with instrumenting [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Using-Edebug.html][see edebug]] the =org-babel-execute:template=
  function, and subsequently evaluate some test-code block. In this way you
  can easily figure out how Babel processes header arguments. Then in
  the end, the result printed by a code block simply consists of the output
  of that function.
- The trick is to process the =vars=, =result-params=, and the =full-body=
  variable (~let~ form within =org-babel-execute:template= function) and
  send the appropriate lines to some inferior process (or as an argument to
  some shell command). The inferior process can be created in the function
  =org-babel-template-initiate-session=. The result returned by the inferior
  process (or by the shell command), should be returned by
  =org-babel-execute:template= (of course you might further process it
  before you return it).
- Don't forget to read the comments in the ob-template file, e.g. for
  sending/receiving output to/from an inferior process. The functions in
  =org-babel-comint= might also be useful.
