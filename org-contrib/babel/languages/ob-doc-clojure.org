* Introduction
Clojure is a dynamic LISP dialect programming language which is built on the Java Virtual Machine (and also CLR and Javascript).

org-babel-clojure allows Clojure code to be executed directly within embedded code blocks in Org-mode documents. 
These code blocks and their results can be included in an exported document.

The following covers details on how to implement Clojure source code blocks in Org Mode documents.

* Requirements
A functional org-mode Clojure code block system requires several technologies:
 * Java 1.5 or greater.  Refer to the [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html][Oracle Java download site]] or to your platform's software installation manager.
 * [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs 24.3]] or greater
 * [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode (development version)]] (as of January 23, 2014)
 * [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]] a LISP style language built on the Java Virtual Machine.
 * The [[http://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] Clojure project system
 * [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode][Clojure Mode]] for optimal editing of Clojure source code in emacs.
 * [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][CIDER]] and IDE and REPL for Clojure.
* Instructions for Installation

The following page is a recommended source of instructions for installing a working emacs/Clojure system.
These instructions assume you already have a working Java installation.

[[http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html][Clojure with Emacs]]

After successful installation using the instructions from the above linked page, the remaining
task is to install the latest org-mode which includes support for CIDER.
Follow the procedure described on this page to install the development version:

[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development][Download and compile the org-mode development version]]

Next, add this line to your .emacs file:
#+begin_example
(add-to-list 'load-path "/full-path-to/org-mode/lisp")
#+end_example
The above code will load the development version of org-mode upon emacs invocation.

** Configure Org-mode

Add these lines to your .emacs file to configure org-mode for Clojure code blocks.
Note that emacs lisp code blocks are turned on by default in org.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org)
  (require 'ob-clojure)
#+END_SRC

** Configure CIDER

Add these lines to your .emacs file to configure CIDER:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle emacs.el
  (setq org-babel-clojure-backend 'cider)
  (require 'cider)
#+END_SRC

** Create a Clojure Project with Leiningen

Create a Leiningen project directory tree:

=lein new clojure-examples=

You should be able to descend into the newly create directory clojure-examples.  You should be able to see
a Clojure project tree.  This would normally be used as an outline of a Clojure project.
For the purposes of demonstrating Clojure source code in org-mode, this
project is only used to allow Leiningen to deal with Java class paths and resolve
dependencies.  In this case, it will download the Clojure core into your machine.  If other
dependencies are required, they should be added to the project.clj file.  Please see
the [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/TUTORIAL.md][Leiningen tutorial]] for further details.  For the purposes of this demonstration,
simply creating the project is sufficient to proceed.

* An Introduction to Org Code Block Evaluation

This is a simple example which evaluates emacs LISP code.
From within the Leiningen project directory, begin editing an org file:

=emacs clojure-examples.org=

Copy the following into the Org buffer:
#+begin_example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (message "Yeah!")
#+END_SRC
#+end_example

Notice that a ``code block'' is delimited by the lines =#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp=
and =#+END_SRC=.

To see how a code block is evaluated, hit =C-c C-c= anywhere within the code block.

The emacs minibuffer displays the output: yeah!
This is the simplest possible example.  There are numerous options
available for output and format of the result of code evaluation.
Options are added to the =#+BEGIN_SRC= line.
Please refer to the org-mode manual for usage of these options.
Another source for information on options is this page at Worg:
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/header-args.html][Header arguments and result types in Org Babel]]
 
Next, a similar process for executing code will be used with Clojure.

* Connect to the REPL

To compile and run Clojure code, you will need to connect to a REPL (Read Evaluation Print Loop).
To connect the current Org buffer to a REPL:

=M-x cider-jack-in RET=

... and wait until you get a confirmation message in the minibuffer.
A second buffer (window) should open, and a CIDER REPL prompt should appear.

* Examples
The following are Clojure code block examples.
** Basic Functionality

Let's start really simple. We will test the evaluation of a
simple Clojure form. Insert the following into the org file:

#+begin_example
#+begin_src clojure :results silent
  (+ 1 4)
#+end_src
#+end_example
    
Now place the cursor in the code block and enter the command:

=C-c C-c=
    
This should evaluate the Clojure form, and echo the results: "5" in the mini-buffer.
    
Now let's insert the results into the buffer immediately after the Clojure code
block. Insert the following into your org file:

#+begin_example
#+begin_src clojure :results value
  [ 1 2 3 4]
#+end_src
#+end_example

Execute as before:

=C-c C-c=
    
Now, immediately following the code block, the following results block will be inserted:

#+begin_example
#+RESULTS
[ 1 2 3 4]
#+end_example

The result of the last form evaluated will be inserted into the results block.

Here is another simple example, with the results of evaluation included:
#+begin_example
#+begin_src clojure :results value
  (def small-map {:a 2 :b 4 :c 8})
  (:b small-map)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 4
#+end_example

** A More Complicated Example- Make a Graph and Insert It into the Document

The next example will use an interesting Clojure based library called [[http://incanter.org/][Incanter]].
The code will demonstrate the creation of a basic x-y line plot using the Incanter xy-plot function.
There is a preliminary step which is required to download the Incanter library into your machine.
In the Leiningen project, there is a file called =project.clj= which must
have the Incanter library dependency added to it as follows:

#+begin_example
(defproject clojure-examples "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.0"]
                 [incanter "1.5.4"]])
#+end_example

After the =project.clj= file is modified, issue the command =lein deps= at the
command line.  You must have an internet connection for this to successfully
download the dependencies into your local machine.

The following code block shows how the Incanter library is
used to create an x-y line plot.  The =view= function will display the plot. 
The plot is also saved to both PDF and PNG format image files.
#+begin_example
#+begin_src clojure
  (use '(incanter core charts pdf))
  ;;; Create the x and y data:
  (def x-data [0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0])
  (def y-data [2.3 9.0 2.6 3.1 8.1 4.5])
  (def xy-line (xy-plot x-data y-data))
  (view xy-line)
  (save-pdf xy-line "incanter-xy-line.pdf")
  (save xy-line "incanter-xy-line.png")
#+end_src
#+end_example

To insert the image into the exported document, add this code:
#+begin_example
  #+CAPTION: A basic x-y line plot
  #+NAME: fig:xy-line
  [[./incanter-xy-line.pdf]]
#+end_example

Note that the file will be saved to the highest level of the Leiningen project.
Depending on where you created the org file, the path to the file may have to be different
than shown.
** Export to LaTeX or HTML

To export to LaTeX, =C-c C-e l l=.
To export to HTML, =C-c C-e h h=.

Note that the exported HTML will hyperlink the PDF file;
to embed the image in the HTML, switch to the PNG image file.
The exported LaTeX (.tex) file will embed either the PDF or PNG file.
Graphical quality will be superior with the PDF file.

* Session Evaluation

By default, each individual code block will execute by starting a Clojure process.
Each code block will execute in isolation from the others.  Due to the start-up
time of a Java virtual machine, this can make execution of many blocks slow.
The :session option will allow control of the process assigned to each code block.
Please refer to the org manual for details on :session usage.

* Specify namespace

By default, each individual code block will execute under CIDER
connection session's current namespace. But you can specify a namespace like bellowing:

#+begin_example
,#+begin_src clojure :results pp
(ns kk.test)
(def he "hi")
,#+end_src

,#+RESULTS:
: #'kk.test/he

You can see the second code block still us individual namespace.

,#+begin_src clojure :results value :ns kk2
(def he "hi")
,*ns*
,#+end_src

,#+RESULTS:
: nil#'kk2/he#namespace[kk2
#+end_example

* Change Clojure cwd in Org-mode way

As this blog post [[https://stardiviner.github.io/Blog/Clojure%2520Plotting%2520to%2520Org%2520inline%2520image%2520in%2520ob-clojure.html][Clojure Plotting to Org inline image in ob-clojure]] mentioned.

Because Clojure is based on JVM, can JVM does not allow to dynamically
change current working directory (=cwd=). So if you use =ob-clojure= in
Org-mode, and need to interact with path, directory, file etc. You
need to figure other ways. Here is an Org-mode way, use header
argument ~:var~ to pass current buffer's path into Clojure, then use
this dir variable in Clojure to construct a correct path.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src clojure :results graphics :dir "data/images" :file "ob-clojure-literate.png" :var dir=(concat (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name)) "data/images/")
(use '(incanter core stats datasets charts io pdf))
(def hist (histogram (sample-normal 1000)))
(save hist (str dir "ob-clojure-literate.png"))
,#+end_src
#+end_src


* Additional Examples

The above set-up and examples were intended for the beginner to achieve success
with Clojure code blocks in org mode documents.

Please refer to the documentation for emacs, Clojure-mode, and CIDER which are
referenced in the requirements session for details on how to enhance the system
beyond the basics described in this tutorial.
