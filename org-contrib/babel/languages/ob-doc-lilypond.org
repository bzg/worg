* Introduction

LilyPond is a music engraving program devoted to producing the
highest-quality sheet music possible. Org-mode supports lilypond
source code blocks that can generate music scores with optional
auditing via MIDI.

* Usage

There are two modes available with ob-lilypond:

- =basic-mode= (default), and
- =arrange-mode=

Which one you use depends on what you intend to do (type =M-x
org-babel-lilypond-toggle-arrange-mode= to switch modes).

* Basic Mode

With =basic-mode= you can embed LilyPond snippets into an Org-mode
file, compile and export them using typical Org-mode commands (such as
=C-c C-e l p= for PDF export). This is useful if you want to mix
blocks of LilyPond-generated score with text, and perhaps other images
to export to LaTeX, Docbook, PDF, or HTML. In other words,
=basic-mode= could be used as a flexible replacement to the
=lilypond-book= command.

Note that in =basic-mode= a lilypond source block requires a =:file=
parameter as shown below.

#+begin_example
#+begin_src lilypond :file mixolydian.png
\relative c' {
  g a b c
  d e f g
  f e d c
  b a g a
  b c d e
  f g f e
  d c b a
  g1
}
#+end_src
#+end_example

The previous block will produce an image file in ~.png~ format, which
would be suitable for exporting to HTML, for instance.

To generate an image suitable for embedding into a PDF/LaTeX document,
you might consider using the ~.pdf~ (or ~.eps~) format as shown in the
following example.

#+begin_example
#+begin_src lilypond :file mixolydian.pdf
\relative c' {
  g a b c
  d e f g
  f e d c
  b a g a
  b c d e
  f g f e
  d c b a
  g1
}
#+end_src
#+end_example

* Examples

- [[file:../examples/lilypond.pdf][Here is an example]] of a PDF file containing high quality vector
  graphics generated by Org-mode and ob-lilypond.
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg/blob/master/org-contrib/babel/examples/lilypond.org][and the Org file]] that compiled the LilyPond snippets and generated
  the PDF.

* Compiling LilyPond Blocks

In =basic-mode=, pressing =C-c C-c= within a lilypond block compiles
the block. Likewise, pressing =C-c C-e= (standard Org-mode export
keys) exports the Org document.

* Arrange Mode

With =arrange-mode= you can develop complete pieces of score whilst
organizing sections of the piece using typical literate programming
techniques. This allows you to assemble scores programatically by
using tables to store information among other methods.

The mode also includes features to audition the piece (via MIDI)
automatically and or display the resultant PDF output. Again, you can
switch modes using the following command:

: M-x org-babel-lilypond-toggle-arrange-mode

Or you can define your mode preference by changing the
=org-babel-lilypond-arrange-mode= variable. Setting it to a non-nil
value makes Arrange Mode the default mode.

Following are examples generated using ob-lilypond in Arrange Mode.

* Tangling and Compiling LilyPond Blocks

In =arrange-mode=, pressing =C-c C-c= within a LilyPond block
initiates =org-babel-lilypond-tangle=, tangling all LilyPond blocks
within the current Org file. Depending on the feature settings,
ob-lilypond will then either /display/ a PDF of the score, /play/ the
generated MIDI file, both, or neither.

The command =org-babel-lilypond-tangle= can also be called from
anywhere in the file and could be tied to a function key with
something like:

: (global-set-key [f8] 'org-babel-lilypond-tangle)

Some commands are included in =arrange-mode= to quickly enable/disable
certain post-tangle activities, including:

- =org-babel-lilypond-toggle-midi-play=, which decides whether to play
  the corresponding MIDI following a successful compilation, and
- =org-babel-lilypond-toggle-pdf-display=, which decides whether to
  display the PDF following a successful compilation.

Note that when using [[http://timidity.sourceforge.net/][Timidity]] for MIDI playback, you can kill the MIDI
stream by pressing =C-g= from Emacs.

* Setup

By default, ob-lilypond is included in the latest Org-mode. For
information on obtaining the latest Org-mode follow this link to the
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html][Org-mode Manual]] and follow the instructions.

Then, add lilypond to your list of babel languages:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((emacs-lisp . t)
   (org . t)
   (lilypond . t)))
#+end_src

Alternatively, you may /require/ the ob-lilypond babel language
directly:

: (require 'ob-lilypond)

To ensure all is correct consider /running the tests/ (see below).

* Requirements

** Mac OS X

- LilyPond may be [[http://lilypond.org/][downloaded here]].

** Nix

- LilyPond is [[http://lilypond.org/][available here]] or via the the system-relevant package
  manager.
- For MIDI, Timidity is [[http://timidity.sourceforge.net/][available here]] or via the system-relevant
  package manager.
- For PDF, Evince is [[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince][available here]] or via package manager.

** Win32

- Currently untested, although it should be made to work with minimal
  fuss.

* Testing

Tests are provided and can be executed by running the following
commands (for more help and information on testing see [[file:../../../org-tests/index.org][Testing Org]]):

: M-x load-file RET  testing/lisp/test-ob-lilypond.el
: M-x ert t

* Issues

Issues should be reported to the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-mailing-list.html][Org-mode Mailing-list]].
