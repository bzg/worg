* Introduction
=Dot= is one of six layout programs in the =Graphviz= open source
graph visualization software, created at AT&T. The =Graphviz= layout
programs take simple text graph descriptions and make useful diagrams
in a variety of formats. =Dot= source code blocks call the =dot=
layout program by default, but can be configured to call any of the
other five =Graphviz= layout programs.

Graph visualization has applications in many technical domains, where
it is often used to explore large data sets. A typical use in =Org
mode= chains the =dot= source code block to a source code block in
another language that is responsible for converting a data table into
source code for one of the =Graphviz= layout languages.

* Requirements and Setup
=Graphviz= is distributed on an open source basis under [[http://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php][The Eclipse
Public License]].  [[http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php][Executable packages]] from AT&T are available for
Linux, Solaris, Windows, and Mac.

You can configure Org mode to execute =dot= source code blocks by
adding a line to =org-babel-load-languages=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
     'org-babel-load-languages
     '((dot . t))) ; this line activates dot
#+END_SRC

Optionally, [[http://users.skynet.be/ppareit/projects/graphviz-dot-mode/graphviz-dot-mode.html][graphviz-dot-mode]] offers font locking, indentation, and
preview of graphs. The variable =org-src-lang-modes= can be customized
to contain an entry that associates =dot= files with
=graphviz-dot-mode=.

* Org Mode Features for =Dot= Source Code Blocks
** Header Arguments
=Dot= source code blocks produce graphics files. The default value for
the =:results= header argument is "file" and for the =:exports= header
argument it is "results".

There are two =dot= specific header arguments that can be used to
               tailor the command line.  They are:
   - =:cmd= :: this header argument can be used to change the layout
               program from the default "dot".  [[http://www.graphviz.org/Home.php][Sensible values]]
               are "neato", "fdp", "sfdp", "twopi", and "circo".
   - =:cmdline= :: the default sets the =dot= flag =-T= to the
                   extension of the output file in order to indicate
                   the output format. =Graphviz= recognizes three
                   dozen [[http://www.graphviz.org/docs/outputs/][output formats]]. [[http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html][Other flags]] that can be set
                   with =:cmdline= control default graph, node, and
                   edge attributes, among other functionality.

The =:file= header argument is required for =dot= source code blocks.

** Sessions
=Dot= does not support sessions.
** Result Types
=Dot= source code blocks produce graphic files, so the default value
"file" is the only sensible type of result.

** Other
=Dot= source code blocks currently do not evaluate variables.

* Examples of Use
A typical use of a =dot= source code block is to produce a graph
visualization of a data set.  In this example, the following input
table 

#+name: dot-eg-table
| a | Hello  |
| b | World! |

is passed to a source code block that is responsible for producing
valid =dot= code 

#+name: make-dot
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var table=dot-eg-table :results output :exports none
  (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
              (princ (format "%s [label =\"%s\", shape = \"box\"];\n"
                             (first x) (second x)))) table)
              (princ (format "%s -- %s;\n" (first (first table)) (first (second table))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,#+name: make-dot
,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var table=dot-eg-table :results output :exports none
  (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
              (princ (format "%s [label =\"%s\", shape = \"box\"];\n"
                             (first x) (second x)))) table)
              (princ (format "%s -- %s;\n" (first (first table)) (first (second table))))
,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

and this is chained to a =dot= source code block 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file images/test-dot.png :var input=make-dot :exports results
graph {
 $input
}
,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

that wraps the input in a =graph{}= command to produce the following
graphic output

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file images/test-dot.png :var input=make-dot :exports results
graph {
 $input
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/test-dot.png]]

An example of chaining source code blocks to produce a =dot= graph is
provided by Schulte et al. in [[http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03][A Multi-Language Computing Environment
for Literate Programming and Reproducible Research]].
