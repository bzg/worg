* Introduction
R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics.  R source code blocks are fully supported in Org Mode with a
wide variety of R-specific header arguments.

R source code blocks in Org Mode can be used to create R packages,
carry out statistical analyses, create graphic displays, and produce
reproducible research papers.

* Requirements and Setup
R source code blocks in Org Mode require a working R installation.
Precompiled binary distributions for Gnu/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
are available at the [[http://cran.r-project.org][Comprehensive R Archive Network]], which also makes
available the source code for compilation on other platforms.

The Emacs mode, [[http://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS)]], is required for
session-based evaluation.  ESS is designed to support editing of
scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis programs
such as R, S-Plus, SAS, Stata, and JAGS. 

You can install ESS from the [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA repository]], using Emacs' package
facility. This is usually the easiest way to install it; if you need
to, instructions for installing from source are found at the [[https://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download][ESS
website]].

To install from Melpa, you need to add it to your
~package-archives~. The MELPA maintainers recommend the following
code:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'package)
(let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
                    (not (gnutls-available-p))))
       (proto (if no-ssl "http" "https")))
  (when no-ssl (warn "\
Your version of Emacs does not support SSL connections,
which is unsafe because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
There are two things you can do about this warning:
1. Install an Emacs version that does support SSL and be safe.
2. Remove this warning from your init file so you won't see it again."))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
  ;; Comment/uncomment this line to enable MELPA Stable if desired.  See `package-archive-priorities`
  ;; and `package-pinned-packages`. Most users will not need or want to do this.
  ;;(add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa-stable" (concat proto "://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) t)
  )
(package-initialize)
#+end_src

Note that the minimal requirement is just to have the line 

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
#+end_src

at the appropriate place in your configuration (i.e., before you call
~package-initialize~).

You also need to ensure that =org-babel-load-languages= includes an
entry for R. Typically, =org-babel-load-languages= will contain many
entries. The example below omits other languages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((R . t)))
#+end_src

** Note for Windows Users
Additional steps may be necessary on Windows. See [[http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-orgmode@gnu.org/msg57159.html][this Org-mode mailing list
thread]] for background information. If when trying to execute R source code from
Org-mode one encouters the message =The system cannot find the path specified=, it
may be necessary to set the variable =org-babel-R-command= in
.emacs. Note the addition of =--slave --no-save= to the custom path, which are
the R defaults for Babel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-R-command "C:/Progra~1/R/R-2.15.0/bin/R --slave --no-save")
#+end_src

Adjust the path appropriately based on your R installation.

For 64bit Windows users, the R installation process may have installed
both 32bit and 64bit binaries. The above path points to the 32bit paths; for
64bit operating systems the analog is:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-R-command "C:/Progra~1/R/R-2.15.0/bin/x64/R --slave --no-save")
#+end_src

* Org Mode Features for R Source Code Blocks
** Header Arguments

There are no R-specific /default/ header arguments.

If a =:file filename.ext= header argument is provided to an R source
block, then the output from the source block will go to the named
file. What that output is depends on the value of the =:results=
header argument.

If the value is =:results file graphics= then "base" graphics output
is captured to the file specified by the ~:file~ argument. A link to
the file is inserted into the Org Mode buffer. **NB: as of org version
9.3, the ~:results~ argument must include both ~file~ and ~graphics~;
earlier versions only required the ~graphics~ argument**. An attempt
is made to find an R graphics device corresponding to the file
extension. Currently, the following extensions are recognized: =.png=,
=.jpg=, =.jpeg=, =.tiff=, =.bmp=, =.pdf=, =.ps=, =.postscript=,
=.tex=, and =.svg=. If the extension of the file name passed to
=:file= is not recognized, PNG format output is created by default.

If the source code block uses grid-based R graphics, e.g., the lattice
and ggplot2 packages, then care must be taken either to print() the
graphics object, specify =:results output=, or run the code in a
=:session=.  This is because the graphics functions from lattice and
ggplot2 return objects that must be explicitly printed to see them,
using the print function.  This happens automatically when run
interactively, e.g., =:session=, but when called inside another
function, it does not.  

Some years ago, Erik Iverson summarized the different ways of getting
this working. His summary, updated to reflect a change in Org
Babel syntax, follows:

: * does /not/ work; produces a file, but it does 
: * not contain a valid graphics format
: #+begin_src R :file 1.png :results file graphics
: library(lattice)
: xyplot(1:10 ~ 1:10)
: #+end_src

: * does produce a file, by printing object
: #+begin_src R :file 2.png :results graphics file
: library(lattice)
: print(xyplot(1:10 ~ 1:10))
: #+end_src

: * does produce a file, by using :results output
: #+begin_src R :file 3.png :results output graphics file
: library(lattice)
: xyplot(1:10 ~ 1:10)
: #+end_src

: * does produce a file, by evaluating in :session
: #+begin_src R :file 4.png :session :results graphics file
: library(lattice)
: xyplot(1:10 ~ 1:10)
: #+end_src

# For further clarification of =:file= and =:results=, see [[https://orgmode.org/list/m1y67jdsgw.fsf@94.196.16.201.threembb.co.uk][this thread]].

*** Graphics Header Arguments
There are many R-specific header arguments used to configure R graphics
devices.  They include:

  - width :: the width of the graphics region, default value is 7
             (inches) or 480 (pixels)
  - height :: the height of the graphics region, default value is 7
              (inches) or 480 (pixels)
  - units :: the units in which width and height are given -- =px=,
             =in=, =cm=, or =mm=. Note that the default units are set
             by the file type: =in= for pdf and ps, =px= for jpeg,
             bmp, png, tiff
  - bg :: the background color defaults to "transparent"
  - fg :: the foreground color defaults to "black"
  - pointsize :: the default point size in the graphics defaults to 12
  - quality :: the quality of a JPEG image as a percentage
  - compression :: the type of compression to be used
  - res :: the nominal resolution in pixels per inch
  - type :: the bitmap type, one of "Xlib", "quartz", or "cairo"
  - antialias :: the type of antialiasing to be used when =type= =
                 "cairo" or =type= = "quartz"
  - family :: in normal use, one of "AvantGarde", "Bookman",
              "Courier", "Helvetica" (default), "Helvetica-Narrow",
              "NewCenturySchoolbook", "Palatino", or "Times" 
  - title :: string to embed as the /Title field in the file defaults
             to "R Graphics Output"
  - fonts :: an R graphics font family name -- "sans", "serif", or "mono"
  - version :: string describing the PDF version required to view the
               output defaults to "1.4"
  - paper :: the target paper size -- "special" (default), "default",
             "a4", "letter", "legal", "us", "executive", "a4r", or
             "USr", where the latter two are rotated to landscape orientation
  - encoding :: the name of an encoding file 
  - pagecentre :: if paper != "special" then a logical that defaults
                  to true and determines whether the graphic device
                  region is centered on the page
  - colormodel :: a character string describing the color model,
                  "srgb" (default), "gray", "grey", or "cmyk".
  - useDingbats :: if TRUE (default) small circles will be rendered
                   with the Dingbats font
  - horizontal :: for the postscript device, a logical that defaults
                  to true and dtermines the orientation of the printed
                  image
  - R-dev-args :: for graphics parameters not directly supported by
                  Org Mode (see below)

 See the R help page for the graphics devices (e.g., using =?png=,
 =?pdf=, =?postscript= in an R session) for additional information on
 these arguments.

 Arguments to the R graphics device can also be passed as a string in
 R argument syntax, using the header arg =:R-dev-args=.  This is
 useful for graphics device arguments that don't have an Org Mode
 header argument counterpart.
    
 The following example source block illustrates use of =:R-dev-args=
 to pass background and foreground colors.  Note that both of these
 arguments can also be passed directly as header args, using =:fg= and
 =:bg=.

#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+header: :width 8 :height 8 :R-dev-args bg="olivedrab", fg="hotpink"
  ,#+begin_src R :file z.pdf :results graphics file
  ,plot(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol=2), type="l")
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

** Sessions
Sessions are fully supported by R source code blocks. They can be used
as one way to preserve state accessed by several source codeblocks. Sessions are also useful for debugging, since it is possible
to view the values of variables created during the session.

** Result Types

R source code blocks can return text or graphical results.

The [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ascii/index.html][ascii package]] coerces R objects to Org Mode, among other markup
languages.  The [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html][Hmisc]], [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/index.html][xtable]] and [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/index.html][tables]] packages contain functions to
write R objects into LaTeX representations.

R is capable of creating graphical displays in several formats.  The
outputs supported by R source code blocks in Org Mode include:

   - bmp :: bitmap image file format commonly used on Microsoft
            Windows and OS/2
   - jpg, jpeg :: Joint Photographics Expert Group method of lossy
            compression for digital photography widely used in a
            number of raster image file formats
   - tex :: output tikz graphics language which can be typeset by
            LaTeX so the fonts for text in the plot match the fonts
            used in the LaTeX document
   - tiff :: a sophisticated raster image format that allows multiple
             pages in a document
   - png :: Portable Network Graphics is a lossless raster image file format
   - svg :: Scalable Vector Graphics is an open standard vector format
            that can be embedded in web pages and readily edited in
            open source software applications such as [[http://inkscape.org/][Inkscape]]
   - pdf :: Portable Document Format can faithfully produce anything R
            graphics can output
   - ps, postscript :: PostScript is a predecessor of PDF that does
                       not support semitransparent colors or
                       hyperlinking

When using R to produce graphical displays, you will typically set
=:results graphics file=.  However, if you use the [[http://had.co.nz/ggplot/][ggplot implementation of
the grammar of graphics in R]], then you will need to set =:results
output graphics file= (see above).

* Examples of Use
** Debugging
   This section contains some tips on how to proceed if your R code is
   not doing what you had hoped.
*** Use =:session=
    Evaluate your code using the =:session= header argument, then
    visit the R buffer (i.e. the buffer containing the "inferior ESS"
    process). Then you can inspect the objects that have been created,
    and try out some lines of code. Useful R functions for inspecting
    objects include (in R, type a "?" followed by the name of the
    function, or use ~C-c C-v~ to use ESS's help browser, to get help
    with the function)
    - str
    - dim
    - summary
*** Use ESS to step through evaluation line-by-line
    1. Use C-c ' to visit the edit buffer for your code block
    2. Use =ess-eval-line-and-step= to evaluate each line in turn

In addition to =ess-eval-line-and-step=, there are several other ESS
functions with names beginning =ess-eval-*=. They evaluate lines and
regions in different ways; it's worth looking at their descriptions
(C-h f).
** Org Mode Output from R
David Hajage's [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ascii/index.html][ascii]] R package creates appropriate plain text
representations of many R objects. It features an option to specify
that the plain text representations should be in Org format. This can
be particularly useful for retrieving non-tabular R data structures in
Org Mode for export.

In R:

The Org Mode source code block specifies =:results org= so the output
is wrapped in =#+BEGIN_ORG= ... =#+END_ORG=.  This way, arbitrary
output can be included and easily replaced on subsequent evaluations
of the source code block.


: #+begin_src R :results output org
:   library(ascii)
:   options(asciiType="org")
:   ascii(summary(table(1:4, 1:4)))
: #+end_src
:
: #+results:
: #+BEGIN_ORG
: - Number of cases in table: 4 
: - Number of factors: 2 
: - Test for independence of all factors:
:   - Chisq = 12, df = 9, p-value = 0.2133
:   - Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
: #+END_ORG

The results in this case are exported as a nested list structure:
#+results:
#+BEGIN_ORG
- Number of cases in table: 4 
- Number of factors: 2 
- Test for independence of all factors:
  - Chisq = 12, df = 9, p-value = 0.2133
  - Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
#+END_ORG


The =caption=, =header=, and =include.colnames= options are useful.


: #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output org
:  library(ascii)
:  a <- runif(100)
:  c <- "Quantiles of 100 random numbers"
:  b <- ascii(quantile(a),header=T,include.colnames=T,caption=c)
:  print(b,type="org")
:  rm(a,b,c)
: #+END_SRC
:

: |------+------+------+------+------|
: | 0.03 | 0.28 | 0.52 | 0.74 | 1.00 |
: #+END_ORG

The output exported to HTML can be quite nice.

** LaTeX code from R
This example summarises a linear regression fit. Usually the Org Mode
user should not have to be involved in LaTeX code generation, because
this is the responsibility of Org Mode's LaTeX export engine. In this
example, neither the printed representation, nor the value of
=summary(lm(y ~ x))= is tabular, and it would therefore require some
work to get the information in to an Org Mode table. However, the
=xtable= package can be used to output a LaTeX table. Using =:results
latex= as a header argument to the R source code block ensures that
this is returned as a LaTeX block in the Org Mode buffer and thus can be
included correctly in LaTex-based export targets.

: #+begin_src R :results output latex
: library(xtable)
: x <- rnorm(100)
: y <- x + rnorm(100)
: xtable(summary(lm(y ~ x)))
: #+end_src

: #+results:
: #+BEGIN_LaTeX

** =ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS=
 When in an Org Mode R code edit buffer with an associated R session,
 =M-x ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS= will bring the R session buffer into
 view and place point at the prompt. ESS binds this to =C-c C-z= and
 =C-M-r= by default.
