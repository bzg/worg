* Introduction

Babel can evaluate C, C++, and D code.

As opposed to interpreted languages, which can be evaluated directly,
C, C++, and D code is first compiled to an executable which is then
run.

If a =main= method is not present in a code block then the entire
block is wrapped in a trivial =main= function call.

Note: there used to be two separate library files, =ob-C.el= and
=ob-D.el=. They have been merged in a single =ob-C.el= file which
handle all three languages.

So, for example, the following simple code block can be evaluated and
the results of evaluation inserted into the buffer.

: #+begin_src C++ :includes <stdio.h>
:   int a=1;
:   int b=1;
:   printf("%d\n", a+b);
: #+end_src
:
: #+results:
: : 2

** About C
C dates back in the 1970.
It was devised by Kernighan & Ritchie.
It was used to create the Unix kernel, and many of its utilities.
Today it is still the base of the Linux & Unix kernel.

** About C++
C++ was devised by Stroustrup in the 1980.
The purpose was to enhance C with object programming.
Among the features introduced by C++, there are:
  - templates and the Standard Template Library,
  - object programming, with class definition and inheritance,
  - functions and operators overloading,
  - exceptions.

** About D
[[http://dlang.org/][D]] is a C++-like language made by [[http://dlang.org/][Digital Mars]].
It features:
  - C++ syntax
  - Built-in garbage collector
  - Strong type system
  - Meta-programming
  - Seamless assembler support
  - Usable as a scripting language
  - C binary compatibility

* Requirements and Setup

1- You must have the compilers available on your computer.
   You may use only one of the three languages:
   there is no requirement to have all three installed.
   - C and C++ often come pre-installed.
     Popular compilers are the GNU ones, called =gcc= and =g++=.
     But others are usable as well.
   - For D, look at http://dlang.org/ for downloading and instructions.
     The compilers are called =dmd= and =rdmd=.

   Eventually, the compilers must be in the =PATH=.

2- Make any or all languages available to Babel.
   Type:
   : M-x customize-variable org-babel-load-languages
   and add the C language (capital "C", which gives access to C, C++, D)

3- Default are given for the compilers: =gcc=, =g++=, =rdmd=. They may be
   customized. Type:
   : M-x customize-group org-babel
   and look for =Org Babel C++ Compiler= and such.

* Org Mode Features for C, C++, D Source Code Blocks
** Header Arguments

- =:var VARIABLE=VALUE= ::
  A global C, C++, or D variable named VARIABLE will be declared
  and initialized with VALUE

  Possible types for VARIABLE may be:
    : int,
    : double,
    : string or const char*,
    : type[]    // type = int, double, string, const char*
    : type[][]  // type = int, double, string, const char*

  The later type, =type[][]=, is used for variables storing Org tables

  The =type[]= is used for lists or vectors declared in the header.

- =:cmdline= :: command line arguments to pass to the executable
     compiled from the code block.

- =:flags= ::
     flags to pass to the compiler.

- =:main= :: can be set to "no" to inhibit wrapping of the code block
     in a =main= function call.

- =:includes= ::
     (C & C++ only)
     accepts either a single string name, or a list of
     names of files to =#include= in the execution of the code block.

- =:import= ::
     (D only) An import statement will be declared in the D source
     before the source code.

- =:defines= ::
     (C & C++ only) just like =:includes= but for =#defines= lines at the
     top of the code.

- =:namespaces= ::
     (C++ only)
     accepts either a single name, or a list of names of namespaces to use.
     The final format will look like this: =using namespace name;=

- =:libs= ::
     (C & C++ only) useful for linking with a library, may be given
     =-L/path/to/lib= and =-llibrary= instructions.

** Sessions
   There is no support for sessions

* Examples of Use
** Hello World in C

Here is Hello World!

#+name: c-hello
#+begin_src C :exports results
  printf ("Hello World!\n");
#+end_src

This source code block:
#+begin_example
#+begin_src C
  printf ("Hello World!\n");
#+end_src
#+end_example

yields this result (type =C-c C-c= in the source block):
#+results: c-hello
Hello World!

** Hello World in C++

#+name: cpp-hello
#+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream>
  std::cout<<"Hello World!\n";
#+end_src

This source code block:
#+begin_example
#+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream>
  std::cout<<"Hello World!\n";
#+end_src
#+end_example

yields this result (type =C-c C-c= in the source block):
#+results: cpp-hello
Hello World!

Note that the =<iostream>= used to be automatically #included, but now
it must be specified through the =:includes= parameter.

** Hello World in D
Here is Hello World!

#+name: d-hello
#+begin_src D :exports results
  writefln ("Hello World!");
#+end_src

This source code block:
#+begin_example
#+begin_src D
  writefln ("Hello World!");
#+end_src
#+end_example

yields this result (type =C-c C-c= in the source block):
#+results: d-hello
Hello World!

** Note that:
- if no =main()= is declared, a trivial one is automatically provided,
- there is no directive like:
  + =#include "stdio.h"= (in C)
  + =import std.stdio;= (in D)
  because those libraries are so common that they are always included.
- C++ needs to explicitely include either =stdio.h= or =<iostream>=

** Scalar variables
Variables may be declared outside the script.
They are automatically inserted at the top of the script.
Three types are supported, based on the look of the value:
  - =string= or =const char*=
  - =int=
  - =double=

Example in C or C++:
#+begin_example
#+header: :var mystring="Sunday" :var myint=145 :var mydouble=3.14
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  printf ("mystring %s\n", mystring);
  printf ("myint    %d\n", myint);
  printf ("mydouble %g\n", mydouble);
#+END_SRC
#+end_example

yields this result (type =C-c C-c=):

#+begin_example
#+RESULTS:
| mystring | Sunday |
| myint    |    145 |
| mydouble |   3.14 |
#+end_example

Example in D:
#+begin_example
#+header: :var mystring="Sunday" :var myint=145 :var mydouble=3.14
#+BEGIN_SRC D
  writefln ("mystring %s", mystring);
  writefln ("myint    %d", myint);
  writefln ("mydouble %g", mydouble);
#+END_SRC
#+end_example

yields this result (type =C-c C-c=):

#+begin_example
#+RESULTS:
| mystring | Sunday |
| myint    |    145 |
| mydouble |   3.14 |
#+end_example

If you want to see the expanded source code, without compiling and running it,
just type =C-c C-v v=.

** Process an Org Mode Table

*** How to handle a table
We take an Org mode table as input, process it, and output
a new Org mode table.

This table will be input in the script, and iterated row by row:

#+begin_example
#+tblname: somedata
| nb    | sqr | noise |
|-------+-----+-------|
| zero  |   0 |  0.23 |
| one   |   1 |  1.31 |
| two   |   4 |  4.61 |
| three |   9 |  9.05 |
| four  |  16 | 16.55 |
#+end_example

The table is converted to a variable in the script:
  : const char* somedata[5][3] = {...};  // in C & C++
  : string      somedata[5][3] = [...];  // in D

The header, if any, is available to the script as well:
  : const char* somedata_header[3] = { "nb", "sqr", "noise" };  // in C & C++
  : string      somedata_header[3] = [ "nb", "sqr", "noise" ];  // in D

The dimensions of the table are available:
  : int somedata_rows = 5;
  : int somedata_cols = 3;

Additionnally, an accessor function retrives a cell using the column
name as found in the header:
  : const char* cell = somedata_h(3,"noise"); // "9.05" in C & C++
  : string      cell = somedata_h(3,"noise"); // "9.05" in D

Type =C-c C-v v= to look at the generate code without running it.

Note that table contents are (almost) always strings
(as opposed to integers or floating point numbers).
This allows to easily handle heterogeneous tables,
and tables with missing values.
To convert a string cell to a numeric value on the fly, use standard convertors:
  : int    cell = atoi(somedata_h(4,"sqr"));        // integer conversion in C & C++
  : double cell = atof(somedata_h(4,"noise"));      //  double conversion in C & C++
  : int    cell = to!int(somedata_h(4,"sqr"));      // integer conversion in D
  : double cell = to!double(somedata_h(4,"noise")); //  double conversion in D

*** Example in C & C++

#+name: c-table
#+header: :exports results
#+begin_src C++ :var somedata=somedata
  int main()
  {
    for (int i=0; i<somedata_rows; i++) {
      printf ("%2d %7s ", i, somedata_h(i,"nb"));
      for (int j=1; j<somedata_cols; j++) {
        const char* cell = somedata[i][j];
        printf ("%5s %5g ", cell, 1000*atof(cell));
      }
      printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

This code:

#+begin_example
#+name: c-table
#+header: :exports results
#+begin_src C++ :var somedata=somedata
  #include "stdlib.h"
  #include "stdio.h"
  int main()
  {
    for (int i=0; i<somedata_rows; i++) {
      printf ("%2d ", i);
      for (int j=1; j<somedata_cols; j++) {
        const char* cell = somedata[i][j];
        printf ("%5s %5g ", cell, 1000*atof(cell));
      }
      printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src
#+end_example

yields this result:

#+begin_example
,#+RESULTS: c-table
| 0 | zero  |  0 |     0 |  0.23 |   230 |
| 1 | one   |  1 |  1000 |  1.31 |  1310 |
| 2 | two   |  4 |  4000 |  4.61 |  4610 |
| 3 | three |  9 |  9000 |  9.05 |  9050 |
| 4 | four  | 16 | 16000 | 16.55 | 16550 |
#+end_example

*** Example in D

#+name: d-table
#+header: :exports results
#+begin_src D :var somedata=somedata
  void main()
  {
    foreach (i, row; somedata) {
      writef ("%2s %7s ", i, somedata_h(i,"nb"));
      foreach (j, cell; row)
        if (j) // skip 1st column
          writef ("%5s %5s ", cell, 1000*to!double(cell));
      writeln();
    }
  }
#+end_src

#+begin_example
#+begin_src D :var somedata=somedata
  void main()
  {
    foreach (i, row; somedata) {
      writef ("%2s %7s ", i, somedata_h(i,"nb"));
      foreach (j, cell; row)
        if (j) // skip 1st column
          writef ("%5s %5s ", cell, 1000*to!double(cell));
      writeln();
    }
  }
#+end_src
#+end_example

yields this result:

#+results: d-table
| 0 | zero  |  0 |     0 |  0.23 |   230 |
| 1 | one   |  1 |  1000 |  1.31 |  1310 |
| 2 | two   |  4 |  4000 |  4.61 |  4610 |
| 3 | three |  9 |  9000 |  9.05 |  9050 |
| 4 | four  | 16 | 16000 | 16.55 | 16550 |


*** Pure numeric table

This table is a pure numeric table.
| 3 | 3.3 |
| 4 | 4.1 |
| 5 | 5.9 |
| 6 | 6.5 |

In this special case, it is translated to a numeric table:
: double MyTable[4][2] = { {3,3.3}, {4,4.1}, {5,5.9}, {6,6.5} };

If there is a blank cell among numeric cells,
then the whole table falls back to the string case,
where the blank cell is translated to the empty string "".

** TODO Lists and vectors in the header

* Shortcomings and known bugs
** C++ vs. cpp
After the =#+begin_src= block header, both =C++= and =cpp= are
accepted to specify C++ language.
However only =C++= works for generated code visualization
through =C-c C-v v=.

** Pure numeric + header  cast error
A type mismatch between strings and double cause an error
when attempting to use the cell accessor with column name
when the table is pure numeric.
