* Introduction
=org-babel-mathomatic= allows Mathomatic statements to be executed directly
within embedded code blocks in Org-mode documents. These code blocks and
its results can be included as the document is exported to documentation
formats. 

The following provides instructions and some examples of Mathomatic
usage. Since babel is simply allowing native code to run inside of
Org-mode, all Mathomatic documentation is applicable and valid.
* Requirements and Setup
Mathomatic is a small Computer Algebra System (CAS) written in C. The
program is quite portable and useful, and quite suitable for small
systems. 

To get Mathomatic up and running, you need the =mathomatic= program
installed in your system. You can obtain and compile =mathomatic= from [[
www.mathomatic.org]]

To enable support for Mathomatic, it must be enabled as part of your
initialization script. For example: 

#+begin_example
;; set up babel support
(require 'org-install)
(require 'ob-mathomatic)
;; add additional languages with (require 'ob-language)
#+end_example

Babel block headers are used to pass various arguments to control the
results of the executed code. The complete list of header arguments
is covered in the Org-mode manual; for now, some options frequently used for
tclsh are:
- =:exports {code, results, both, none}=
  - When the code is run and the document exported (e.g. to HTML or
    \LaTeX PDF), what should appear? Just the code block itself? Only
    the produced output (in this case a plot of some sort)? Both the
    code and the accompanying results? Or nothing?
- =:results {value, output}=
  - Controls the results of the output. Only two alternatives are
    allowed: 
  - /value/ :: Returns the value of the last =return= statement in the
               code. and places in =#+RESULTS:=. 
  - /output/ :: Returns the value of the =puts= or =write= statement and
                places those in =#+RESULTS:=. 
- =:file foo.{png,eps,etc.}=
  - Mathomatic uses gnuplot as its plotting engine. Using the =:file=
    option specifies where the resulting output should be put. If
    no option is given, a Gnuplot window will open with the
    resultant plot. 
    *NOTE:* Certain plot options may /not/ output
    properly to Gnuplot directly and thus /must/ have the =:file
    filename= option in the header. If the error "Code block produced
    no output" recurs, try outputting to a file. 

* Overview
Mathomatic is a comprehensive CAS that includes many options and
features. 
Describing these are beyond the scope of this
manual. However, the examples provided in this guide should 
be easy enough to follow to
those that have used similar programs in the past. 
interested in learning about Mathomatic, please refer to the official documents
or books on the subject. [fn:1]

Through this overview, Any of the commands
typed in =code= font below should be assumed to reside in a babel
code block (between =#+begin_src mathomatic= and =#+end_src=).

To run a Mathomatic block  and produce a result from the babel block
move the cursor anywhere in the code
block and press =C-c C-c= (Ctrl+C followed by Ctrl+C) and type "yes"
in the minibuffer when asked about executing the code.

** Basic Use
An example of a Mathomatic  block in Org-babel is as follows:

#+begin_example
#+begin_src mathomatic :results output
x + 2
eliminate x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: mathotest
: #1: x = 0
: #2: x + 2
: Eliminating variable x using solved equation #1...
: #2: 2
#+end_example 

Using =:results output= describes all the steps executed in the
code. using =:results value= will write the results in a table. For
example:

#+begin_example
#+begin_src mathomatic :results value
x = 0
x + 2
eliminate x
ans = x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| #1:         | x        | = |     0 |        |          |       |
| #2:         | x        | + |     2 |        |          |       |
| Eliminating | variable | x | using | solved | equation | #1... |
| #2:         | 2        |   |       |        |          |       |
| #3:         | ans      | = |     x |        |          |       |
#+end_example


** Graphical output
Graphical output is supported in Mathomatic which can be stored using
the =:file= header option. The following output formats are supported
within Mathomatic: [fn:2]
- Encapsulated Postscript =.eps=
- Portable Network Graphics =.png=
- Postscript =.ps=
- Groff PIC =.pic=

#+begin_example
#+begin_src mathomatic :results graphics :file sine.png
plot sin(x)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:sine.png]]
#+end_example 

In order to get graphical output during evaluation use the Mathomatic =plot=
command within Mathomatic. The file suffix will configure Gnuplot to
write the right file format. 

** Named Procedures
The Babel Mathomatic plugin supports the use of named procedures and calls
operations. The use of these are detailed in the /Org Manual/.  This
manual will describe how they are used within the context of a Mathomatic
script.

A variable can be passed to a Mathomatic script which can be used to call the
aforementioned program later on in your org document.  The following
example is a program that evaluates X+2. 

#+begin_example
#+name: mathotest(x=0)
#+begin_src mathomatic :results output
x + 2
eliminate x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: mathotest
: #1: x = 0
: #2: x + 2
: Eliminating variable x using solved equation #1...
: #2: 2
#+end_example

Calling the named script with a different value will result in a
different execution. For example: 

#+begin_example
#+call: mathotest(x=30)

#+RESULTS: mathotest(x=30)
: #1: x = 30
: #2: x + 2
: Eliminating variable x using solved equation #1...
: #2: 32
#+end_example

Note that table processing is not supported. This is because Mathomatic
does not have support for matrixes. However there are 
plans to provide this in the future through the use of simulated
arrays.  A simulated array is a syntactic sugar in Mathomatic to enclose
indexes in square brackets (/[]/). 

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Mathomatic manual downloads and further information can be obtained
from: [[http://www.mathomatic.org/math/doc/index.html]]

[fn:2] Mathomatic uses Gnuplot as its plot engine. All plot modes are
supported in Mathomatic. However, for convenience, only these are
supported in the =:file= option.
