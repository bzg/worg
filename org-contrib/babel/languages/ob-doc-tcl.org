* Introduction
=org-babel-tcl= allows Tcl code to be executed directly
within embedded code blocks in Org-mode documents. These code blocks and
its results can be included as the document is exported to documentation
formats. 

The following provides instructions and some examples of tclsh
usage. Since babel is simply allowing native code to run inside of
Org-mode, all tclsh documentation is applicable and valid.

* Requirements and Setup
To get Tcl  up and running, you need the =tclsh= interpreter installed in your
system or any of its variants: 

  - =wish= if you want GUI support
  - =expect= for interactions with the console 
  - =ns2= to run network simulations from Org-mode. 

The variable =org-babel-tcl-command= defines the value of the
interpreter that will be run. It defaults to =tclsh=. 

To enable support for Tcl, it must be enabled as part of your
initialization script. For example: 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; set up babel support
(require 'org)
(require 'ob-tcl)
;; add additional languages with (require 'ob-language)
#+end_src

* Babel Header Arguments

Babel block headers are used to pass various arguments to control the
results of the executed code. The complete list of header arguments
is covered in the Org-mode manual; for now, some options frequently used for
tclsh are:

- =:exports {code, results, both, none}=
  - When the code is run and the document exported (e.g. to HTML or
    \LaTeX PDF), what should appear? Just the code block itself? Only
    the produced output (in this case a plot of some sort)? Both the
    code and the accompanying results? Or nothing?
- =:results {value, output}=
  - Controls the results of the output. Only two alternatives are
    allowed: 
  - /value/ :: Returns the value of the last =return= statement in the
               code. and places in =#+RESULTS:=. 
  - /output/ :: Returns the value of the =puts= or =write= statement and
                places those in =#+RESULTS:=. 
* Overview and Use
Tcl is a complete language that provides a rich set of
facilities. Describing these are beyond the scope of this
manual. However, the examples provided in this guide should 
be easy enough to follow to
those that have program in other languages in the past.  If you are
interested in learning about Tcl, please refer to the official documents
or books on the subject. [fn:1]

Through this overview, Any of the commands
typed in =code= font below should be assumed to reside in a babel
code block (between =#+begin_src tcl= and =#+end_src=).

To run a Tcl block  and produce a result from the babel block
move the cursor anywhere in the code
block and press =C-c C-c= (Ctrl+C followed by Ctrl+C) and type "yes"
in the minibuffer when asked about executing the code.

** Basic Use 
The easiest way to use this feature is to create a block of 
=#+begin_src tcl= / =#+end_src= and enter your commands there. The 
default is to return a value being this the last value from a =return=
statement. 

#+begin_example
,#+begin_src tcl
  return "Hello"
,#+end_src

,#+RESULTS: 
: Hello
#+end_example

In this example, pressing C-c C-c will result in the value "Hello" being
written in the =#+RESULTS:=.  Placing a =puts= or =write= statement
will *not* show up in the =#RESULTS:= 
To change this behavior, the keyword
=:results output= must be written in the header. For example: 

#+begin_example
,#+begin_src tcl :results output
puts "Hi"
return "Hello"
,#+end_src 

,#+RESULTS:
: Hi
#+end_example

** Named Procedures and Tables
The Babel Tcl plugin supports the use of named procedures, calls  and table
operations. The use of these are detailed in the /Org Manual/.  This
manual will describe how they are used within the context of a Tcl
program. 

A variable can be passed to a Tcl program which can be used to call the
aforementioned program later on in your org document.  The following
example is a program that just writes the value of the variable. 

#+begin_example
#+name: reflector(x=0)
,#+begin_src tcl :results output
puts $x
,#+end_src

,#+RESULTS: reflector
: 0
#+end_example 

Pressing =C-c C-c= will result in the default value to be written. Calling
the named block later on with a different value will result on that
value been written in the =#RESULTS:= For example: 

#+begin_example
,#+call: reflector(20)
,#+RESULTS: reflector(20)
: 20
#+end_example

This is not constrained only to =:results output= headers. Procedures in
which the result is a =value= can also be used. For example: 

#+begin_example
,#+name: square(x=0)
,#+begin_src tcl :results value
return [expr $x * $x]
,#+end_src

,#+RESULTS: square
: 0
#+end_example

Executing it with C-c C-c with different values will result to that value being
returned. For example:

#+begin_example
,#+call: square(x=2)

,#+RESULTS: square(x=2)
: 4
#+end_example 

Sending Tcl code as part of the parameter is also supported. For
example: 

#+begin_example
,#+call: square(x=[expr 2 + 10])

,#+RESULTS: square(x=[expr 2 + 10])
: 144
#+end_example 

Table processing is supported in Tcl blocks. The resultant data
structure in  Tcl is a list of lists. For example: 


#+begin_example
,#+tblname: testtbl
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |

,#+name: processtbl(x=0)
,#+begin_src tcl :results output
puts $x
foreach y $x {
  puts [expr [lindex $y 0] * [lindex $y 1]]
}
,#+end_src
#+end_example

The program prints the table as a list, add the first and second values and
writing the results. Calling this block later on in the Org document
will result in the following output.

#+begin_example
,#+call: processtbl(x=testtbl)

,#+RESULTS: processtbl(x=testtbl)
: {1  2}  {3  4}
: 2
: 12
#+end_example
