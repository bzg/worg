* Introduction

We introduce the use of emacs org-babel model in this document.  Emacs
Org-Babel mode is a literate programming tool (aka. active document), which
can embed multiple programming languages, inlcuding R, in one document.
Another popular literate programming tool for statisticians is the Sweave
document, which can embed only R code.

First we clarify the following terminologies:

- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] :: The extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
           display editor.

- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Org-mode]] :: An Emacs Mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists,
              doing project planning, and authoring with a fast and
              effective plain-text system.

- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel]] :: It is Org-mode's ability to execute source code within
           Org-mode documents.

* How to Use

** Installation

(August 5, 2011) =Babel= is available after Org-mode version 7.0, while
Emacs version 23.2.1 still only has Org-mode version 6.33x.  Thus you need
to update Org-mode (currenly at version 7.7) from [[https://orgmode.org][Org Home Page]].  You can
use Emacs Package Manager to install Org-mode easily following [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#installing-via-elpa][this
instruction. ]]

** Keyboard Shortcuts

To write a code block in a =.org= file, you can simple type =<s=
followed by TAB key.  Then a skeleton like the following is
automatically inserted:

#+begin_example
,#+begin_src 

,#+end_src
#+end_example

All you need to do next is type a single letter =R= in the header and
begin typing R code:

#+begin_example
,#+begin_src R
  ## Edit Your R Code Here.
  x <- rnorm(100)
  summary(x)
,#+end_src
#+end_example

I recommend you to edit R code in [[http://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]] (Emacs Speaks Statistics) mode by
typing =C-c '= (i.e. C-c and single quote) within the code block, which
brings up a separate window with ESS enabled. After editing, you can type
=C-c '= again to return to the main file buffer.

Once you finish writing the code, you can execute them immediately by
pressing =C-c C-c= and see the R output being inserted into the document.
Alternatively, you can press =C-c C-o= to see the R output in a separate
window.

To generate (export to) HTML document, press =C-c C-e h h=.  Note other
document options are available upon pressing =C-c C-e=.

** Emacs Customization Settings

The Org-Babel mode can be customized through the emacs menu item "Org",
which can be saved to your ".emacs" file for future use. Some useful
Org-Babel settings for statisticians are:

#+begin_example
(custom-set-variables
 '(org-babel-load-languages (quote ((emacs-lisp . t) (R . t))))
 '(org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
#+end_example

which specifies =R= language to be loaded and R code to be evaluated
without prompt.

I also specify a "skeleton" in my ".emacs" file so as to start writing
Org file quickly:

#+begin_example
(define-skeleton org-skeleton
  "Header info for a emacs-org file."
  "Title: "
  "#+TITLE:" str " \n"
  "#+AUTHOR: Your Name\n"
  "#+email: your-email@server.com\n"
  "#+INFOJS_OPT: \n"
  "#+BABEL: :session *R* :cache yes :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes \n"
  "-----"
 )
(global-set-key [C-S-f4] 'org-skeleton)
#+end_example

where

- The =#+INFOJS_OPT= option will generat a HTML document that is
  foldable and follows the style of =GNU/INFO= document.
- The =:session *R*= option makes sure all the R code is run in the
  same session so objects generated in one code block can be accessed
  from other code blocks.
- the =:cache yes= option is used to avoid re-evaluating unchanged
  code blocks.  This can save significant time when you revise a
  document with a lot of R code frequently. 
- The =:results output graphics :exports both= option will put both
  the R code and its text and graphics output in the generated
  document.
- The =:tangle yes= option allows the document to be "tangled" to
  generate pure code file.  The short-cut key for tangling is =C-c C-v
  t=, which generates a =.R= file with all the R code extracted. 
- Note the "-----" string will generate a horizontal line in HTML
  file. 
- Finally, a hotkey =C-S-f4= (while pressing Ctrl and Shift keys,
  press F4 key) is assigned to invoke this skeleton quickly. 

** A Complete Example

We use the following file =test-for-how-to-use-Org-Babel-for-R.org= as an
example file.

#+INCLUDE: "test-for-how-to-use-Org-Babel-for-R.org" example

# The exported HTML file is shown as [[file:test.html][test.html]].

** Caveats

- Keep the code block indented correctly. Otherwise the graph will not
  be embedded in the HTML export file.
- Always have the contents and plots under a section heading to avoid
  certain exporting errors.
- It makes things easier if the working directory in *R* session
  buffer is the same as the directory of the .org file that
  you are writing.  In this way, the plot files can easily be found. 
- The macro option (=#+MACRO:=) cannot be used to save the typing
  of header options for code blocks.  For example, it does NOT work if
  you try to use

  #+begin_example
  ,#+MACRO: p  :file $1.png :width 1000 :height 800
  #+end_example

  to shorten the header to

  #+begin_example
  ,#+begin_src R {{{p(plot)}}}
  #+end_example
