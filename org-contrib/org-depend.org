* General

/org-depend.el/ demonstrates a mechanism for creating TODO
dependencies.  Note that Org-mode does already have [[https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-dependencies.html#TODO-dependencies][built-in local
dependencies]] which are simpler and cover most of what one usually
wants to do.  However, the built-in implementation covers only the
following two concepts:

- blocking an entry from changing its state to DONE while it still has
  children that are not done, or checkboxes that are unchecked
- blocking an entry from changing its state to DONE while it still has
  un-done siblings above it, in this way enforcing sequential work on
  the siblings

/org-depend.el/ was originally a proof-of-concept implementation of
TODO dependencies, using two special hooks, =org-blocker-hook= and
=org-trigger-hook=.  It remains in the distribution as an example on
how more complex dependencies between entries can be implemented.  In
particular it shows how to implement the following:

- Dependencies on remote entries identified by ID.  These entries do
  not have to be near-by and may even be located in a different file.
- The possibility to /trigger/ actions in other entries.

* What is implemented?

** Triggering

1) If an entry contains a TRIGGER property that contains the string
   =chain-siblings(KEYWORD)=, then switching that entry to DONE does
   do the following:
   - The sibling following this entry switched to todo-state KEYWORD.
   - The sibling also gets a TRIGGER property =chain-sibling(KEYWORD)=,
     property, to make sure that, when *it* is DONE, the chain will
     continue.

2) If an entry contains a TRIGGER property that contains the string
   =chain-siblings-scheduled=, then switching that entry to DONE does
   the following actions, similarly to =chain-siblings(KEYWORD)=:
   - The sibling receives the same scheduled time as the entry
     marked as DONE (or, in the case, in which there is no scheduled
     time, the sibling does not get any either).
   - The sibling also gets the same TRIGGER property
     =chain-siblings-scheduled=, so the chain can continue.

3) If the TRIGGER property contains the string
   =chain-find-next(KEYWORD[,OPTIONS])=, then switching that entry
   to DONE do the following:
   - All siblings are of the entry are collected into a temporary
     list and then filtered and sorted according to =OPTIONS=
   - The first sibling on the list is changed into =KEYWORD= state
   - The sibling also gets the same TRIGGER property
     =chain-find-next=, so the chain can continue.

   OPTIONS should be a comma separated string without spaces, and can
   contain following options:

   - =from-top= the candidate list is all of the siblings in the
     current subtree
   - =from-bottom= candidate list are all siblings from bottom up
   - =from-current= candidate list are all siblings from current item
     until end of subtree, then wrapped around from first sibling
   - =no-wrap= candidate list are siblings from current one down
   - =todo-only= Only consider siblings that have a todo keyword
   - =todo-and-done-only= Same as above but also include done items.
   - =priority-up=   sort by highest priority
   - =priority-down= sort by lowest priority
   - =effort-up=     sort by highest effort
   - =effort-down=   sort by lowest effort

   There is also customizable variable =org-depend-find-next-options=
   that contains default options if none are specified. Its default
   value is =from-current,todo-only,priority-up=

4) If the TRIGGER property contains any other words like
   =XYZ(KEYWORD)=, these are treated as entry IDs with keywords.
   That means, Org-mode will search for an entry with the ID property
   XYZ and switch that entry to KEYWORD as well.

** Blocking

1) If an entry contains a BLOCKER property that contains the word
   =previous-sibling=, the sibling above the current entry is
   checked when you try to mark it DONE.  If it is still in a TODO
   state, the current state change is blocked.

2) If the BLOCKER property contains any other words, these are
   treated as entry IDs.  That means, Org-mode will search for an
   entry with the ID property exactly equal to this word.  If any
   of these entries is not yet marked DONE, the current state change
   will be blocked.

3) Whenever a state change is blocked, an org-mark is pushed, so that
   you can find the offending entry with =C-c &=.

* Example

When trying this example, make sure that the settings for TODO keywords
have been activated, i.e. include the following line and press C-c C-c
on the line before working with the example:

#+begin_example
  ,#+TYP_TODO: TODO NEXT | DONE
#+end_example

OK, here is the example.

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Win a million in Las Vegas
    :PROPERTIES:
      :ID: I-cannot-do-it-without-money
    :END:

    The "third" TODO (see above) cannot become a TODO without this money.


,* Do this by doing a chain of TODOs
,** NEXT This is the first in this chain
     :PROPERTIES:
       :TRIGGER: chain-siblings(NEXT)
     :END:

,** This is the second in this chain

,** This is the third in this chain
     :PROPERTIES:
       :BLOCKER: I-cannot-do-it-without-money
     :END:

,** This is the forth in this chain
     :PROPERTIES:
       :TRIGGER: XYZ-is-my-id(TODO)
     :END:

     When this is DONE, we will also trigger entry XYZ-is-my-id

,** This is the fifth in this chain

,* Start writing report
     :PROPERTIES:
       :ID: XYZ-is-my-id
     :END:
#+end_src

* Advanced Triggerring Example

In advanced example we will add a hook to automatically insert
=chain-find-next= TRIGGER when entry is changed to NEXT and
automatically remove it otherwise.

First evaluate the following lisp code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun mm/org-insert-trigger ()
  "Automatically insert chain-find-next trigger when entry becomes NEXT"
  (cond ((equal org-state "NEXT")
         (unless org-depend-doing-chain-find-next
           (org-set-property "TRIGGER" "chain-find-next(NEXT,from-current,priority-up,effort-down)")))
        ((not (member org-state org-done-keywords))
         (org-delete-property "TRIGGER"))))

(add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook 'mm/org-insert-trigger)
#+end_src

Now in the following org file, try changing item TODO state to
NEXT. You should see properties drawer appear with the TRIGGER
property inside.

Try marking the NEXT item DONE. The next item should automatically
become NEXT.

Change priority of one of the items to =[#A]=, then mark the NEXT item
DONE. The highest priority item will automatically become NEXT.

#+begin_src org
#+TYP_TODO: TODO NEXT | DONE

,* Auto-NEXT example
,** TODO Make me NEXT, then mark me DONE
,** TODO Second item
,** TODO Third item
,** Plain item
,** TODO Change my priority
#+end_src

* Usage Examples

[[http://karl-voit.at/2016/12/18/org-depend/][Here is a blog article]] that shows the usage of org-depend in
combination with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnipet]] or [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad][yankpad]].

An advanced workflow with dependencies is auto-generated from a
template snippet using the =BLOCKER= and =TRIGGER= keywords.

Some of those things were demonstrated in [[http://karl-voit.at/2014/12/03/emacs-chat/][an Emacs Chat by Sacha Chua
with Karl Voit]].

[[http://karl-voit.at/2016/12/18/org-depend/][The blog article]] further discusses some ideas on how to improve the
=org-depend= functionality with an ID picker, a mnemonic ID
auto-generator, a workflow assistent, advanced =TRIGGER= commands to
add scheduled dates, and inheritance of todo-cancelation.
