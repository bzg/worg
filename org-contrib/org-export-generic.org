* Overview

org-export-generic is basically a simple translation system that
knows how to parse most of an org buffer and then add
various formatting prefixes before and after each section type.

* Using It

org-export-generic does its work by examining a property list stored
in =org-generic-alist=.  The pre-defined list currently includes a
simple text exporter, a simple html exporter, a wikipedia exporter,
an exporter to IETF internet-draft format, and a "demo" exporter which
shows off all of the potential variables you can set.

You can also dynamically add property lists of your own using the
org-set-generic-type function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (org-set-generic-type
    "really-basic-text" 
    '(:file-suffix     ".txt"
      :key-binding     ?R
      :title-format "=== %s ===\n"
      :body-header-section-numbers t
      :body-header-section-number-format "%s) "
      :body-section-header-prefix  "\n"
      :body-section-header-suffix "\n"
      :body-line-format "  %s\n"
      :body-line-wrap   75
      ))
#+end_src

*Note:* Upper case key-bindings are reserved for your use.  Lower case
key bindings may conflict with future export-generic publications.

Then run org-export (ctrl-c ctrl-e) and select generic or run
org-export-generic.  You'll then be prompted with a list of export types
to choose from, which will include your new type assigned to the key "R".

* Property List Definitions

  The property list items that can be used to format the output are
  defined in the table below.

  Generally speaking, many parts are
  often divided into sections such that every parsed org /thing/
  frequently has 3 output specifiers too it.  E.G., /thing/ might have
  /thing-prefix/, /thing-suffix and /thing-format/.  The first is a prefix
  placed before the output contents, the second is a suffix and 
  /thing-format/ is a format string where a %s is expected to be in
  it.  There is a bit of redundancy with this triple combination but
  it provides flexibility (and in a few places, it's actually needed
  because the format string may be called multiple times and the
  prefix and suffix only once).

*** Property List Value Types

    Many of the property list values can be one of a different types.
    In particular, all of the /prefix/ and /suffix/ tags can be one of
    the following types:

    - A string (e.g., "<foo>")
    - A character, which gets repeated by the length of he line to be
      converted.  This is most useful for headers where you wish to
      place a line underneath the header text.  EG:

:     :header-prefix             ?=

      Will produce:

:     Property List Value Types
:     =========================
     
      For this section.

    - A list of the above two types.  The list elements will be taken
      based on the order of the header indent amount (ie, the number
      of asterisks).  The list can be a mix of types too:
    
:     :header-prefix             (?= ?- "<h3>" "<h4>")

*** Generic HTML Exporter

    Here's a starting template for making a very basic HTML export.
    It's not nearly as sophisticated and complete as org-mode's
    default HTML exporter, but it serves as a good example for how to
    accomplish a basic export structure:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (org-set-generic-type
    "really-basic-html" 
     :file-suffix     ".html"

     ;; simple html output
     :file-suffix        	    ".html"
     :key-binding                   ?h

     :header-prefix             "<body>"

     :title-format              "<h1>%s</h1>\n\n"

     :date-export        	    t
     :date-format               "<br /><b>Date:</b> <i>%s</i><br />\n\n"

     :toc-export                nil

     :body-header-section-numbers 3

     :body-section-header-prefix  ("<h1>" "<h2>" "<h3>"
				   "<h4>" "<h5>" "<h6>")
     :body-section-header-format  "%s"
     :body-section-header-suffix  ("</h1>\n" "</h2>\n" "</h3>\n"
				   "</h4>\n" "</h5>\n" "</h6>\n")

     :body-section-prefix         "<secprefix>\n"
     :body-section-suffix         "</secsuffix>\n"
;	 :body-section-prefix         ("<sec1>\n" "<sec2>\n" "<sec3>\n")
;	 :body-section-suffix         ("</sec1>\n" "</sec2>\n" "</sec3>\n")

     :body-line-export-preformated t
     :body-line-format             "%s\n"

     :body-text-prefix "<p>\n"
     :body-text-suffix "</p>\n"

     :body-bullet-list-prefix      (?* ?+ ?-)
;	 :body-bullet-list-suffix      (?* ?+ ?-)
     )
#+end_src
