* BOM introduction

  This add-on collects components across the entire org buffer (even
  in drawers), making it easy to retrieve and sort data. It uses the
  column special name as a landmark. We will refer to them as
  'Keywords'. The keywords are searched using a string-match function,
  which gives the ability to have multiple column with the same
  functionality, but also to use the column name as we would usually
  with org-mode. For example, we can have 'tag' and 'tag2', both are
  recognized by the BOM add-on and can be used in a spreadsheet-like
  formula without any confusion. The keywords are also
  case-insensitive. 'Component' and 'component' will work in the same
  way.

  The BOM is usually used with a dynamic block. (You can use the
  different functions in emacs-lisp code, but this is beyond the
  purpose of this tutorial.) Here is the basic dynamic block:

:  #+BEGIN: bom
:  #+END:

  And here is what we obtain at this point:
:  #+BEGIN: bom
: | Section | Tag | Component | Quantity |
: |---------+-----+-----------+----------|
:  #+END:

  The table is empty, because we have to either:
  1. Add keywords in a table;
  2. Add a line-component.

* BOM keywords
** Component

     This is the most important keyword and act as the trigger. For
  this example, let's say we write down things we want to buy. In 
  this case, a new keyboard for our computer.  This is how the
  table should be:
  
:  |   | Material  |
:  | ! | Component |
:  |---+-----------|
:  |   | Keyboard  |
  
  The '!' character is used in org table to specify column name, such
  as our keyword, 'component'.
  And here is what the bill-of-materials for this table is:
     
:  #+BEGIN:  bom 
: | Section   | Tag | Component | Quantity |
: |-----------+-----+-----------+----------|
: | Component |     | Keyboard  |        1 |
:  #+END:

  As you can see, the heading (Component) was automatically
  used as the 'section', which doesn't require attention for
  now. The quantity is, unsurprisingly, 1. There is nothing in the tag
  column for now, so let's dismiss it by adding the parameter *:no-tag
  t*. 
  This will results in the following:
:  #+BEGIN: bom  :no-tag t
: | Section   | Component | Quantity |
: |-----------+-----------+----------|
: | Component | Keyboard  |        1 |
:  #+END: 
  
  Now suppose that our friend too wants a new keyboard.

:  |   | For    | Material  |
:  | ! |        | Component |
:  |---+--------+-----------|
:  |   | Me     | Keyboard  |
:  |   | Friend | Keyboard  |
     
:   #+BEGIN: bom :no-tag t
:  | Section   | Component | Quantity |
:  |-----------+-----------+----------|
:  | Component | Keyboard  |        2 |
:   #+END:

  As expected, we get 2 keyboards.
     
** Section
   
     The section is used to separate what would otherwise be an
  identical component. Suppose we don't want our friend's wishes to be
  in the same BOM as our, but still have them in the same table.

:  |   | For     | Material  |
:  | ! | Section | Component |
:  |---+---------+-----------|
:  |   | Me      | Keyboard  |
:  |   | Friend  | Keyboard  |

  This will results in the following BOM:
 
:  #+BEGIN: bom :no-tag t
: | Section | Component | Quantity |
: |---------+-----------+----------|
: | Friend  | Keyboard  |        1 |
: | Me      | Keyboard  |        1 |
:  #+END:

  Please note that when a component is given a section, it isn't
  associated with the heading anymore. As an alternative, you can set
  a ':SECTION:' property in the heading, which will be inherited by
  all the components _without_ a specified section.
  Section's priorities are as follow: 

  1. Given section with the 'section' keyword;
  2. The SECTION property;
  3. The heading.

** Qty

     With this keyword, it is possible to specify a quantity for the
  associated component. In our always improving scenario, we now want to
  give a keyboard to another of our friend (as a gift). This is going to
  be bought at the same time as our keyboard, so they belong together.

:  |   | For     | Material  |     |
:  | ! | Section | Component | Qty |
:  |---+---------+-----------+-----|
:  |   | Me      | Keyboard  |   2 |
:  |   | Friend  | Keyboard  |   1 |

:   #+BEGIN: bom :no-tag t
:  | Section | Component | Quantity |
:  |---------+-----------+----------|
:  | Friend  | Keyboard  |        1 |
:  | Me      | Keyboard  |        2 |
:   #+END:
     
  *Important*: If Qty keyword is present, then any empty field will
  be considered as _zero_. This way, multiple column quantity are
  made quite easily:
     
:  |   | For     | Material  | Personal | Gift |
:  | ! | Section | Component |      Qty | Qty2 |
:  |---+---------+-----------+----------+------|
:  |   | Me      | Keyboard  |        1 | 1    |
:  |   | Friend  | Keyboard  |        1 |      |

:   #+BEGIN: bom :no-tag t
:  | Section | Component | Quantity |
:  |---------+-----------+----------|
:  | Friend  | Keyboard  |        1 |
:  | Me      | Keyboard  |        2 |
:   #+END:  

** Tag

     When a BOM starts to get big, we often need a quick reminder of
  why we need certain component. Another use is also to identify the
  component. As the Qty keyword, multiple Tag columns can be associated
  with a single component. Here we will simply use the tag as a reminder
  of what we want to look for in the store.

:  |   | For     | Material  | Personal | Gift | Need               |
:  | ! | Section | Component |      Qty | Qty2 | Tag                |
:  |---+---------+-----------+----------+------+--------------------|
:  |   | Me      | Keyboard  |        1 | 1    | Matching colors    |
:  |   | Friend  | Keyboard  |        1 |      | Dinosaurs pictures |

  To show the tag column in the BOM, we simply remove the no-tag
  parameter.
:  #+BEGIN: bom
: | Section | Tag                | Component | Quantity |
: |---------+--------------------+-----------+----------|
: | Friend  | Dinosaurs pictures | Keyboard  |        1 |
: | Me      | Matching colors    | Keyboard  |        2 |
:  #+END:  
  

  If two Tag columns are present for a single Component column, the
  tags will be associated with this component, separated by a comma.

* Renaming BOM columns
     
     It is possible to rename the BOM columns with the following
  parameters:
  - col-name-component
  - col-name-section
  - col-name-quantity
  - col-name-tag
  - col-name-description
  - col-name-price

  This is how our renamed BOM would look like:
     
:  #+BEGIN: bom :col-name-section For :col-name-tag Need :col-name-component Stuff :col-name-quantity Qty
: | For    | Need               | Stuff    | Qty |
: |--------+--------------------+----------+-----|
: | Friend | Dinosaurs pictures | Keyboard |   1 |
: | Me     | Matching colors    | Keyboard |   2 |
:  #+END:  

* Multiple component's column

     There is two way to add components in a section. Either by adding
  other rows with the same section's name, or by adding other
  columns. Both have their uses and they should come to you quite
  naturally. In our example, we want more stuff.

:  |   | For     | Material  | Personal | Gift | Need               | Stuff     | More stuff | Much more stuff | How many |
:  | ! | Section | Component |      Qty | Qty2 | Tag                | Component | Component  | Component       | Qty      |
:  |---+---------+-----------+----------+------+--------------------+-----------+------------+-----------------+----------|
:  |   | Me      | Keyboard  |        1 | 1    | Matching colors    | Mouse     | Headset    | USB flash drive | 23       |
:  |   | Friend  | Keyboard  |        1 |      | Dinosaurs pictures |           |            |                 |          |
:  |   | Friend  |           |          |      |                    |           |            | CDs             | 50       |
:  |   | Friend  | Mouse     |        1 |      |                    |           |            |                 |          |
     
  This is beginning to get interesting. Note that even if we can
  name the additional columns 'Component2' or 'ComponentAAA',
  there's no use to do it if no table-formula uses the column
  names. 

* Precise section selection
  Now suppose we want to get OUR to-buy list. Simply specify
  the section's parameter *:section Me*:

:   #+BEGIN: bom :section Me
:  | Tag             | Component       | Quantity |
:  |-----------------+-----------------+----------|
:  |                 | Headset         |        1 |
:  | Matching colors | Keyboard        |        2 |
:  |                 | Mouse           |        1 |
:  |                 | USB flash drive |       23 |
:   #+END:  
     
  Wait, where's the section column?  Well we don't need it anymore,
  as we specified one.

  A '+' sign will specify we want more than a single section. *:section
  Me+Friend* will select both section, and add the quantity and tags
  for each component. 

:  #+BEGIN: bom :section Me+Friend
: | Tag                                 | Component       | Quantity |
: |-------------------------------------+-----------------+----------|
: |                                     | CDs             |       50 |
: |                                     | Headset         |        1 |
: | Dinosaurs pictures, Matching colors | Keyboard        |        3 |
: |                                     | Mouse           |        2 |
: |                                     | USB flash drive |       23 |
:  #+END:

  *Do not* put a whitespace between the section name and the '+' sign.
  Speaking of whitespace, if you need one in a section name, simply
  put it in a string: 
: #+BEGIN: bom :section "Section with whitespace"

  We can also return every section that matches at least what we
  provide. To activate this, use *:part-match t*. With this, if we
  write "fr", the Friend section is returned. If we had another
  section named "Frosting", than Friend and Frosting would have been
  merged and we would have a total for both section.

:  #+BEGIN: bom :section fr :part-match t
: | Tag                | Component | Quantity |
: |--------------------+-----------+----------|
: |                    | CDs       |       50 |
: | Dinosaurs pictures | Keyboard  |        1 |
: |                    | Mouse     |        1 |
:  #+END:

  It is also possible to specify that we don't want any section
  containing "fr". For this, use the parameter *:remove t*.

:  #+BEGIN: bom :section fr :part-match t :remove t
: | Tag             | Component       | Quantity |
: |-----------------+-----------------+----------|
: |                 | Headset         |        1 |
: | Matching colors | Keyboard        |        2 |
: |                 | Mouse           |        1 |
: |                 | USB flash drive |       23 |
:  #+END:

  In this case, getting all sections not containing "fr" is the
  equivalent of choosing the section "Me".

  If you simply want the components from the current heading, use the
  parameter *:local-only t*. This will return components with the
  current heading as their section, which is the default of every
  component if no section is provided. If a section has been provided to
  a component (and is not exactly equal to the heading), the component
  will not be returned.

  Here, we don't have any component under this heading:
:  #+BEGIN: bom :local-only t
: | Tag | Component | Quantity |
: |-----+-----------+----------|
:  #+END:

* BOM total
  This is all really interesting, but when we're in a shop, we want
  to know how many of each item we have to buy, we need a *total*.
  For this, simply add the *:total t* parameter. We will also remove
  the tags once again by using *:no-tag t*.

:  #+BEGIN: bom :total t :no-tag t
: | Component       | Quantity |
: |-----------------+----------|
: | CDs             |       50 |
: | Headset         |        1 |
: | Keyboard        |        3 |
: | Mouse           |        2 |
: | USB flash drive |       23 |
:  #+END:

  This is the equivalent of merging every sections together.
* Adding a component without a table

  There is another option you might need. If you ever want to
  add a component without a table, use the #+BOM commentary. As any
  other org-mode commentary, this one won't appear when exported to
  another document (pdf, html, docbook..). It will, however, enable
  you to add a single component in the bill-of-materials. Here is an
  example:
:  #+BOM: Keyboard :section Need :tag "Matching colors"

  As with the table components, you can simply give a component name if
  you desire. If no section is given, it will be inherited as an
  ordinary component in a table: a section property or the current
  heading.

* Adding details
  There is two way to add details to a BOM. The first one is to setq
  `org-bom-details' with a plist containing, depending on your
  needs, :description, :datasheet-pdf and :price. You must, however, at
  least have the component name in the :name property. Here is an
  example on how to set this variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-bom-details '((:name "Keyboard" :description
                          "Something" :price "40") 
                          (:name "CDs" :description "Not
                          DVDs" :datasheet-pdf "CD.pdf")))
#+END_SRC
  Please note that the price is a *string*.

  The other method, valid for the current buffer only, is to give one
  or more bom-details table. It is recognized when a table is named as
  such:
:  #+TBLNAME: bom-details

  Once again, the column names are used. Contrary to the normal BOM
  keywords however, these are case-sensitive and must be written
  exactly as their property name. For example, the column of the
  property ':name' must be 'name'.
:  #+TBLNAME: bom-details
: | ! | name     | description  | price |
: |---+----------+--------------+-------|
: |   | Keyboard | Used to type |    40 |
: |   | CDs      |              |       |
  
  Any bom-details table will temporarily overshadow the
  `org-bom-details' variable, but won't erase or modify it. This means
  you can safely use a bom-details table if you need to change some
  local buffer description, while using `org-bom-details' in multiple
  buffer.

  Look at the CDs description. When a field is empty, it is *not* used
  and BOM falls back to the property in the `org-bom-details'
  variable.
  
** Description
   
   You can add a description column in a BOM by adding the
   *:description t* parameter. 

:   #+BEGIN: bom :total t :no-tag t :description t
:  | Component       | Quantity | Description  |
:  |-----------------+----------+--------------|
:  | CDs             |       50 | Not DVDs     |
:  | Headset         |        1 | N/A          |
:  | Keyboard        |        3 | Used to type |
:  | Mouse           |        2 | N/A          |
:  | USB flash drive |       23 | N/A          |
:   #+END:

   See how the CDs' description wasn't the empty field from the
   bom-details table.

** Price
   
   You can add a price column in a BOM by adding the *:price t*
   parameter.

:   #+BEGIN: bom :total t :no-tag t :description t :price t
:  | Component       | Quantity | Price | Description  |
:  |-----------------+----------+-------+--------------|
:  | CDs             |       50 |       | Not DVDs     |
:  | Headset         |        1 |       | N/A          |
:  | Keyboard        |        3 |   120 | Used to type |
:  | Mouse           |        2 |       | N/A          |
:  | USB flash drive |       23 |       | N/A          |
:  |-----------------+----------+-------+--------------|
:  | TOTAL:          |          |   120 |              |
:      #+TBLFM: @>$3=vsum(@I..@>>)
:   #+END:
   The price is automatically multiplied by the quantity of each
   component. In addition, a total row is added at the table's bottom
   with a vertical sum formula.
   
** Datasheet
   
   This is a special property and must be used only if you intend to
   export in a pdf document. See [[LaTeX mode and bom-datasheet]] for more details.
   
* List of BOM parameters
  Here is a list of all the parameters usable in a BOM dynamic block,
  as seen throughout this tutorial:

  - no-tag :: Remove the tags column
  - section :: Select this section (or more if there's a + sign)
  - part-match :: Select every section with at least the string
                  provided for the section parameter
  - remove :: Select every sections except the one(s) provided
  - descripton :: Add the description column
  - price :: Add the price column and a total row at the bottom of the
             table
  - col-name-*** :: Rename the associated column
* Advanced and elisp functions
** Speed up updates
   Each BOM dynamic block scans the entire buffer individually. While
   it is necessary that each block be able to update itself, it
   becomes a waste when the command `org-update-all-dblocks' is
   used. (The components usually aren't changing from a dblock evaluation to
   another.)
   
   In order to speed up updates, there's a variable that can be used
   to stop each BOM dblock from doing a buffer-wide scan. To disable the
   scans, set `org-bom-update-enable' to nil.

   The author uses a function similar to this one to speed up updates:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code
(defun reg-update-project (&optional latex-mode)
  "Update every table and dynamic block in the buffer. If latex-mode
is non-nil, various latex commands will be inserted."
  (interactive)
  (org-table-iterate-buffer-tables)
  (org-bom-total); manually update the BOM database
  (let ((org-bom-update-enable nil)
	(org-bom-latex-mode latex-mode)
	(org-bom-details (copy-tree org-bom-details)));so we don't overwrite
    (org-bom-check-for-details-table); manually update `org-bom-details'
    (org-update-all-dblocks))
  (message "Project updated"))
#+END_SRC
     
** LaTeX mode and bom-datasheet
  This mode isn't fully integrated to org-mode and should be seen as a
  hack. It is however useful to the author, which is why it is
  explained here.

  Set the `org-bom-latex-mode' variable to non-nil in order to
  activate the latex-mode. If set, all BOM dynamic block will insert
  some latex commands.

  These commands targets:
  - Tags :: When there is more tags than `org-bom-latex-max-tags' per
            component, the remaining tags are put in a pdf comment.
  - Component name :: If a datasheet exists for the component, its
                      name will become a link to its datasheet.

		     
  If you ever activate the LaTeX mode, use the bom-datasheet dynamic
  block at the end of your document. The optional parameter
  *:description t* will add a summary of all the components used in
  this buffer with their description, just before the datasheets.

: #+BEGIN: bom-datasheet
:  
: #+LaTeX: \includepdf[pages=-,landscape=true,addtotoc={1, subsection, 1, CDs,CD.pdf}]{\DATASHEETPATH/CD.pdf}
:  
: #+END:

  As you may have noticed, there's a LaTeX variable in this command:
        \DATASHEETPATH. In order to work, you must set this variable
        using:

: #+LATEX_HEADER: \newcommand{\DATASHEETPATH}{Name-of-the-folder/}'

	Name-of-the-folder is the folder where the datasheets' files
        are located.
