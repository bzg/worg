* Overview

  This code will allow you to grab the current link or selection from
  an open mac application and insert it as a hyperlink at point in an
  org-mode document.

*** Supported Applications

    The following applications are currently supported:
    - Finder.app
    - Mail.app
    - Address Book.app
    - Safari.app
    - Skim.app
    - Firefox.app
    - Firefox.app with the Vimperator plugin
    - Google Chrome.app
    - Brave.app
    - Microsoft Outlook.app
    - Together.app
    - DEVONthink Pro Office.app
    - Evernote.app
    - qutebrowser.app

* Installation

  Org-mac-link has its own repository [[https://gitlab.com/aimebertrand/org-mac-link][on GitLab]].

  It's also available in [[https://melpa.org/#/org-mac-link][MELPA]].

* Customizing

  Customize the org group by typing =M-x customize-group RET org-mac-link RET=.

  You may also optionally bind a key to activate the link grabber menu, like
  this:

  : (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
  :   (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c g") 'org-mac-link-get-link)))

* Usage

  Activate the grabber by typing =C-c g= (or whatever key you decided to bind,
  as above), or type =M-x org-mac-link-get-link RET=. This will give you a menu in
  the modeline allowing you to select an application. The current selection in
  that application will be inserted at point as a hyperlink in your org-mode
  document.

* Customizing

  You may customize which applications appear in the grab menu by customizing
  the group /org-mac-link/. Changes take effect immediately. If you are using
  the org-mode version >=8.2, you can also customize whether the
  =org-mac-link= should highlight the selected text when grabbing the link from
  Skim.app.
