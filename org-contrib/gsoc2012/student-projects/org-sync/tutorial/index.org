/An Org-sync tutorial/

* Introduction

Org-sync is a tool to synchronize online bugtrackers with org
documents.

* Installation

** Check out Org-sync
*** TODO Fix the repo link
Make sure to checkout the same revision this tutorial was written with.

#+begin_src sh
git clone git://orgmode.org/org-sync.git
git checkout 8222ec31f
#+end_src

** Org-element

Org-sync uses Nicolas Goaziou's new parser, org-element.  It's in the
contrib directory of Org-mode which is not included in vanilla Emacs.

If you don't have it you can download a recent version from the
Org-mode repo and move it to your Org-sync directory.

#+begin_src sh
wget -O org-element.el 'https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/5057ae0fc2c0d551a83d3c3e9bd621b751db9f09/contrib/lisp/org-element.el'
#+end_src

** Loading

Add Org-sync directory to your load-path and load the backend you
want.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/org-sync")
(mapc 'load
      '("org-element" "os" "os-bb" "os-github" "os-rmine"))
#+end_src

Phew!  Still there?  Good because it's starting to get interesting...

* Tutorial

There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbj6-j0teCY][demo video on youtube]] that covers the Bitbucket backend and
conflicts handling.  Check it out.

In this tutorial we will sync some bugs from [[http://github.com/ostesting/test][this github repo]].

There are 3 interactive command in Org-sync:

- =os-import= to import a document in the current buffer at point.
- =os-sync= to sync all the imported documents in the buffer.
- =os= which does both depending on the buffer content.  It calls
  =os-import= if there is nothing to sync in the buffer, =os-sync=
  otherwise.

Open a new buffer, switch to org-mode (=M-x org-mode=).

To import a document in a new buffer you can just run =M-x os=.  It
prompts you for an URL.

[[file:import.png]]

Org-sync should import the issues from the repo.

[[file:import-ok.png]]

Now, let's try to change an issue.  First you have to set a
user/password to be able to modify the issue remotely.

Set the variable =os-github-auth= to like so:
=(setq os-github-auth (cons "ostesting" "thisisostesting42"))=.

Here I have just typed it in my org-buffer, put the cursor after the
last closing paren and hit =C-x C-e=.

[[file:auth-setup.png]]

I've made some change in the first issue. Let's sync with =M-x os=.

[[file:first-sync.png]]

Once it's done you should see a message indicating it.

[[file:sync-ok.png]]

You can check on github to make sure it worked:

[[file:on-github.png]]

Now, let's try to add a new issue.  Insert something like =** OPEN my
test issue=.  You can type a description under it if you want.

[[file:try-new.png]]

The next step is simple, just run =M-x os=.  It will sync all issues
in the buffer. If you don't see the new issue, it was probably added
at the bottom of the list, just scroll down you buffer.

* How to write a new backend

Writing a new backend is easy.  If something is not clear, try to read
the header in =os.el= or one of the existing backend.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; backend symbol/name: demo
;; the symbol is used to find and call your backend functions (for now)

;; what kind of urls does you backend handle?
;; add it to os-backend-alist in os.el:

(defvar os-backend-alist
  '(("github.com/\\(?:repos/\\)?[^/]+/[^/]+"  . os-github-backend)
    ("bitbucket.org/[^/]+/[^/]+"              . os-bb-backend)
    ("demo.com"                               . os-demo-backend)))

;; if you have already loaded os.el, you'll have to add it
;; manually in that case just eval this in *scratch*
(add-to-list 'os-backend-alist (cons "demo.com" 'os-demo-backend))

;; now, in its own file os-demo.el:

(require 'org-sync)

;; this is the variable used in os-backend-alist
(defvar os-demo-backend
  '((base-url      . os-demo-base-url)
    (fetch-buglist . os-demo-fetch-buglist)
    (send-buglist  . os-demo-send-buglist))
  "Demo backend.")


;; this overrides os--base-url.
;; the argument is the url the user gave.
;; it must return a cannonical version of the url that will be
;; available to your backend function in the os-base-url variable.

;; In the github backend, it returns API base url
;; ie. https://api.github/reposa/<user>/<repo>

(defun os-demo-base-url (url)
  "Return proper URL."
  "http://api.demo.com/foo")

;; this overrides os--fetch-buglist
;; you can use the variable os-base-url
(defun os-demo-fetch-buglist (last-update)
  "Fetch buglist from demo.com (anything that happened after LAST-UPDATE)"
  ;; a buglist is just a plist
  `(:title "Stuff at demo.com"
           :url ,os-base-url

           ;; add a :since property set to last-update if you return
           ;; only the bugs updated since it.  omit it or set it to
           ;; nil if you ignore last-update and fetch all the bugs of
           ;; the repo.

           ;; bugs contains a list of bugs
           ;; a bug is a plist too
           :bugs ((:id 1 :title "Foo" :status open :desc "bar."))))

;; this overrides os--send-buglist
(defun os-demo-send-buglist (buglist)
  "Send BUGLIST to demo.com and return updated buglist"
  ;; here you should loop over :bugs in buglist
  (dolist (b (os-get-prop :bugs buglist))
    (cond
      ;; new bug (no id)
      ((null (os-get-prop :id b)
        '(do-stuff)))

      ;; delete bug
      ((os-get-prop :delete b)
        '(do-stuff))

      ;; else, modified bug
      (t
        '(do-stuff))))

  ;; return any bug that has changed (modification date, new bugs,
  ;; etc).  they will overwrite/be added in the buglist in os.el

  ;; we return the same thing for the demo.
  ;; :bugs is the only property used from this function in os.el
  `(:bugs ((:id 1 :title "Foo" :status open :desc "bar."))))
#+end_src

That's it.  A bug has to have at least an id, title and status
properties.  Other recognized but optionnal properties are
=:date-deadline=, =:date-creation=, =:date-modification=, =:desc=.
Any other properties are automatically added in the =PROPERTIES= block
of the bug via =prin1-to-string= and are =read= back by org-sync.  All
the dates are regular emacs time object.  For more details you can
look at the github backend in =os-github.el=.

* More information

You can find more in the =os.el= commentary headers.

There is also [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbj6-j0teCY][demo video on youtube]] that covers the Bitbucket backend
and conflicts handling.  Check it out.
