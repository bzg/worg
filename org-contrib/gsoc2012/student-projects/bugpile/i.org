/A framework for dynamic webprogramming with GNU Emacs Org-mode/

* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: intro
  :END:

iOrg is a pure Org-mode and Emacs web framework with
persistence and versioning through dVCs. It aims at extending
Org-modes static webpublishing capacities with dynamcic components
(like html forms and buttons that allow user interaction) and database
functionality (storing and querying state). 

The web framework abstracts away all of the boilerplate required for
its [[id:lang-tools][components]] to work together, allowing application builders the
freedom to focus on the logic of their particular applications.

* The Example Application
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ex-app
  :END:
** Bugpile
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bugpile
   :END:
A bug tracker (bugpile) is used as an example application for iOrg
which provides an interactive web interface and bug reports stored in
Org-mode files. A 'lightweight--version' of a systematic software
engineering approach is used for the development of bugpile, that can
be used as a guide for developing web applications with iOrg.
** About Bugtrackers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bugtrackers
   :END:
*** Why bugtrackers matter
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bugtr-matter
    :END:

The following quote from [[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html][Joel Spolsky]] emphases the importance of
bugtrackers for good software development:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
: Do you have a bug database?
: 
: I don't care what you say. If you are developing code, even on a team
: of one, without an organized database listing all known bugs in the
: code, you are going to ship low quality code. Lots of programmers
: think they can hold the bug list in their heads. Nonsense. I can't
: remember more than two or three bugs at a time, and the next morning,
: or in the rush of shipping, they are forgotten. You absolutely have to
: keep track of bugs formally.
: 
: Bug databases can be complicated or simple. A minimal useful bug
: database must include the following data for every bug:
: 
:   - complete steps to reproduce the bug
:   - expected behavior
:   - observed (buggy) behavior
:   - who it's assigned to
:   - whether it has been fixed or not
: 
: If the complexity of bug tracking software is the only thing stopping
: you from tracking your bugs, just make a simple 5 column table with
: these crucial fields and start using it.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Elements of a good bug report
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: elem-bug-report
    :END:

Again citing [[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html][Joel Spolsky]], here are the three fundamental elements of
a good bug report:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
: It's pretty easy to remember the rule for a good bug report. Every
: good bug report needs exactly three things.
: 
:  1. Steps to reproduce,
:  2. What you expected to see, and
:  3. What you saw instead.
#+END_QUOTE

# ** The design of bugtrackers

** Popular free bugtrackers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: free-bug-tracker
   :END:
From the many free bugtrackers available, two have been of special
importance as inspiration and reference for the bugpile project:

- bugzilla :: a feature-rich, established and well documented
              [[http://www.bugzilla.org/][bugtracker]].
- flyspray :: an uncomplicated, web-based [[http://flyspray.org/][bug tracking system]], used
              by ArchLinux.

* Requirements Analysis
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: req-analysis
  :END:
** Real World vs Software World
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: real-world-vs-sw-world
   :END:
When applying an software-engineering like approach to (web)
application programming, it is important to be aware of the
distinction between the problem domain (in the real world) and the
solution domain (in the software world). The /requirements analysis/
is all about the real world and the users point of view. Even when
doing a one man project with only imaginary users that can't be
interviewed, the programmer should try to take on the role of a user
in this phase. The following phases (/specification/ and /design/)
transform the real-world model of the /analysis/ into a software model
in the solution space, which can then be implemented.

**** Change the state of a bug from TODO to DONE
First lets assume that we have a list of bugs stored in an Org-mode
document on the file system.  Each bug will be represented by a
headline with some meta-data stored in the properties, e.g.,

#+begin_src org
  ,* bugs
  ,** TODO foo doesn't work
  ,   :PROPERTIES:
  ,   :submitted-by: user-x
  ,   :assigned-to: user-y
  ,   :priority: HIGH
  ,   :ID:       515a1747-8ee1-42a7-8ca1-9a0c38844218
  ,   :END:
  ,I don't like it when =foo= doesn't work.  Here's my reproduction
  ,information...
  ,** TODO bar works too well
  ,   :PROPERTIES:
  ,   :submitted-by: user-y
  ,   :assigned-to: user-z
  ,   :priority: LOW
  ,   :ID:       cda87532-62f5-413d-a748-17bc909064f8
  ,   :END:
  ,Feature =bar= works too well and is making =foo= look bad, please stop
  ,showing off.
#+end_src

A remote user navigates to the bug listing page in her browser, the
browser requests the page from elnode, which requests the html export
of the page from Org, which reads the page from the file system,
exports to html which is then passed back to elnode which serves the
page.  Some JS is inserted into each headline adding buttons for
perform actions like changing the properties of a bug, editing its
contents etc...

The user has just completed the first bug "foo doesn't work", so she
hits the [close this bug] button.  The associated JS is run sending an
async post request to the server holding the id of the heading and the
data =state->DONE=.  Elnode parses this post request, and calls the
associated elisp function passing in the Org-id and the new state as
arguments.  This elisp function uses the Org-mode API to change the
state in the actual file on disk, it possibly also calls the
`vc-checkin' function (see vc.el) to commit the new version of the
file to the repository.

After this action is performed, Org-mode re-exports the changed
subtree to HTML.  This new HTML is returned by the function to elnode,
which sends it as a response to the async JS request.  On the browser
side the subtree holding this subtree is replaced with the new HTML
(in which the state is marked as DONE).

**** View a previous version of a wiki page
A user browses to a wiki page.  The corresponding page is rendered by
Org-mode to HTML and is wrapped in a wiki-specific template either by
the Org-mode publishing system or by elnode or by some combination of
the two (the framework).

Along those items included in the wrapping template are buttons for
reverting to a previous version.  The user selects this button sending
a request to elnode.  Elnode parses this request and calls the
corresponding vc function to list recent commits with commit messages.
These are then converted to HTML by elnode (possibly with the help of
Org-mode), and are displayed to the user.

The user selects a particular commit sending a request to the server.
This request includes the commit ID.  This ID is handed to a vc
function which checks out a version of the file at that ID, hands this
file to Org-mode which exports it to HTML, which is then handed to
elnode and served to the user.

# This would also require specifying the format of these
# Org-mode files (e.g., what properties do bugs have), and writing elisp
# functions which could be used outside of the framework e.g., for
# searching and sorting bug reports.

*** Requirements Oriented UML Activity Diagrams (ROA)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: req-oriented-act-uml
   :END:      

UML activity diagrams are well suited for modelling complex activities
with several alternative flows. Based on the [[id:use-case-txt][textual descriptions]] we
develop one diagram for each use case. While the meaning of the
diagrams should be self-explanatory (in fact, their main /razon
d'etre/ is easy communication with non-technical users), there are
some abbreviations and symbols that require explanation:

| <roa>     | requirements oriented activity |
| <<UA>>    | User Activity                  |
| <<UD>>    | User Decision                  |
| <<SA>>    | (complex) System Activity      |
| <<SD>>    | System Decision                |
| <<UC>>    | Use Case                       |
| *⋔*       | (pitchfork) sub-activity       |
| <<scene>> | basic elements of web UI       |


Each /activity/ has one startpoint and one or several endpoints. Each
/user activity/ is associated with a /scene/. Other /use cases/ that
are included in the use case modelled, as well as complex /system
activities/, are marked as subactivities with a pitchfork (⋔). Only
complex system activities are considered, not simple stuff like
storing form data. 

/note: use 'C-x 8 RET pitchfork' (type 'pit' then TAB for completion) to/
/enter the ⋔ character with Emacs (⋔ is used to mark subactivities)/

Based on the assumption that an Org-mode file can be modeled as a kind
of class hierarchy with inheritance and instantiation, a class model
can be developed for the application. With the file itself (loosly)
interpreted as a kind of abstract root class that can not be
instantiated but has global attributes, and the tree nodes (loosly)
interpreted as class definitions that can be instantiated (several
nodes of the same type at the same tree level) and inherited from
(subnodes), object-oriented design techniques can be applied to
Org-mode files. Of course the similarities only go so far, and do
exist only on the conceptual level. The implementation in Emacs Lisp
is based on functions and (e.g.) lists as data stores that are in no
way encapsulated into formal classes that are part of the language
core.
