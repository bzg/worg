* General 

=org-collector= collects headline properties into tables with optional
pre-processing.


* How to use it

** Quick Examples

As a quick demonstration of use of =org-collector= first [[Loading it (No surprises here)][load it]] as
described below.  Then download this [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-collector-example.org][example file]], which contains the
following headlines/properties.

[[file:../images/org-collector/dec-spending.png]]

This property information can then be collected into tables.

*** Simple Example

Lets look at the following org-collector block.

: #+BEGIN: propview :id "december" :conds ((string= SPENDTYPE "food")) :cols (ITEM AMOUNT)
: #+END:

To evaluate this block press =\C-c\C-c= with your cursor on the
=#+BEGIN= line of the block.  Evaluation will result in the following

: #+BEGIN: propview :id "december" :conds ((string= SPENDTYPE "food")) :cols (ITEM AMOUNT)
: | "ITEM"                           | "amount" |
: |----------------------------------+----------|
: | "Grocery Store [2008-12-01 Mon]" |    56.77 |
: | "Restaurant [2008-12-08 Mon]"    |    30.67 |
: |----------------------------------+----------|
: |                                  |          |
: #+END:

Lets look at the arguments one by one.

- :id "december" ::
  The =:id= argument has the effect of limiting the search to headers
  under the header with the id of "december".
- :conds ((string= SPENDTYPE "food")) ::
  The =:conds= argument accepts a list of e-lisp expressions.  Only
  headlines which match all of these expressions will be displayed in
  the table.  The names of properties of a headline, in upper cases,
  can be used as variables in the expressions.  This particular
  expression only returns true when the =SPENDTYPE= property of a
  headline is equal to "food".
- :cols (ITEM AMOUNT) ::
  The =:cols= property controls what each row of the table should look
  like.  In this case we are showing =ITEM= which shows the actual
  text of the headline as well as =AMOUNT= which show the value of the
  =AMOUNT= property of each headline.



*** More Complex Example

This example demonstrates a couple of new headline arguments for
=org-collector=.

: #+BEGIN: propview :cols (ITEM (+ 400 AMOUNT)) :scope tree :match "example"
: | "ITEM"                                                                          | "(+ 400 AMOUNT)" |
: |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------|
: | "December Spending                                                   :example:" |                0 |
: | "Week One"                                                                      |                0 |
: | "Grocery Store [2008-12-01 Mon]"                                                |           456.77 |
: | "Athletic club [2008-12-02 Tue]"                                                |            475.0 |
: | "Week Two "                                                                     |                0 |
: | "Restaurant [2008-12-08 Mon]"                                                   |           430.67 |
: |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------|
: |                                                                                 |                  |
: #+END:

- :cols (ITEM (+ 400 AMOUNT)) ::
  Notice that the =:cols= list in this example contains an elisp
  expression for one of the column values.  It is possible to run
  arbitrary elisp over the header properties the results of which will
  be used when building the resulting table.
- :scope "tree" :match "example" :: 
  The =:scope tree= and =:match= header arguments limits the included
  headlines to those which have a tag matching "example" or their
  descendents.


** Loading it (No surprises here)

The easiest way is by

: M-x package-install RET org-contrib

for [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-release-notes.html][Org-9.5 and later]] and

: M-x customize-variable RET org-modules

Check the line for collector.  This will cause it to be loaded every
time you start org-mode.

You'll still have to load it manually the first time.

Of course, you can also just try it out by loading it manually.

If you prefer to manually customize your emacs then make sure that the
path to org's contrib directory is in your load-path and add the
following to your =.emacs=.

: (require 'org-collector)
