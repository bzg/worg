* The Name of the Game

  *WARNING This documentation is likely to be out of date.*

  org-info-js (subsequently called /the script/) implements part of
  Emacs Org-mode in it's XHTML-exported files, allowing them to be
  rendered and browsed in a linuxdoc/texinfo style.

  This documentation is one XHTML file, exported from one *.org file
  using a single keyboard shortcut. No additional postprocessing was
  done.  There are no external dependencies and the script is small
  and fast, even for large files.  It is used on the [[http://orgmode.org/Changes.html][org-mode site]] to
  display =ORGWEBPAGE/Changes.org= which has over 220.

  If you don't mind using it despite the /health warnings/ and
  adjusting your org export options occaisionally we wish you good
  luck and hope the fun will outweigh your effort.

  There are some drawbacks though. It is currently not possible to
  open internal links in another tab (e.g. using middle click in
  Firefox) due my poor JavaScript knowledge. This is not very high on
  my TODO list since the history mechanism of the script is a good
  alternative to tab usage.

  A list of Changes can be found [[changes.org][here]] (separat file).

  Go to the next section by pressing '=n='.

  Find out about shortcuts in section [[Shortcuts]] (and come back here
  pressing '=b=').

  '=?=' will show all shortcuts available.

** <<Terms used throughout this Document>>

   I tend to talk about view modes. One may toggle the view mode by pressing
   '=m=' or click the /toggle view/ link. Currently two view modes exist.

   + *info view mode* ::
     This mode displays the sections one by one, paged like the typical
     linuxdoc or texinfo files. This is the view mode you should face when
     first visiting this documentation.

   + *plain view mode* ::
     This mode displays the entire file. In this mode the sections are foldable
     by clicking the headlines or pressing '=f=' (fold). The entire structure
     of the document my be (un-)folded using '=F='.

   + *presentation mode* ::
     This mode displays sections one by as slides. Still
     very rustic and experimental. Rick Moynihan embarked and we plan a separat
     tool for presentations.

   *T.O.C.* is used for the table of contents. The table of contents may be
   visited using '=i=' (index) regardless of its visibility.

   A *section* is everything with a headline.


* <<Features>>

** Appearance

   + *Toggle plain view, info view and presentation* ::
     One can click the script-generated links in info view mode to read through
     the whole file page by page. By clicking on '/toggle view/' (or pressing
     `m´) you can switch between info and plain view mode. The presentation mode
     is very rudimentary and just a quick hack realy. Press 'x' to see it.
   + *Keep place in file when toggling* ::
     When changing the view mode via the '/toggle view/' links, the reader gets
     the same part of the document presented after the view change as he saw
     before.
   + *Cut the TOC* ::
     You may cut the table of contents to a certain depth. The splitting of the
     document is not affected by this option. Hence you might set the level of
     headlines to 4, but cut the TOC to show only the first two levels.
   + *Optional subindexes* ::
     The script optionally creates subindexes under the headline of a section
     containing subsections not exceeding =org-export-headline-levels=. This
     was done to get a more texinfo/linuxdoc kind of feel and a better
     orientaton.
   + *Startupview customizable* ::
     Choose how to display the document on load. Info-like or plain and more.
   + *Toggle links everywhere / only on top* ::
     You may choose to display the '/toggle view/' links above every headline
     or just next the current sections headline.
   + *Numbered pages* ::
     In info view mode every page gets a page number starting from one.
   + *Markright alike headings* ::
     Info view mode only. Similar to the =\markright= command in LaTeX
     the Title of the current sections parent appears on top of each page. In
     subsections this heading can be use as link up to start of the parent
     section (see top of this page when you're in info view mode). You can move
     to the parent section by pressing `u´ (up).
   + *Tooltips* ::
     Moving the mouse on the navigation links shows a tooltip with name of
     next/previous section.
   + *Hide T.O.C.* ::
     The T.O.C. can be hidden completly. Hitting '=i=' still will show it. When
     showing the T.O.C. hitting '=i=' any navigation command ('=n=', '=p=',
     '=s='...) will trigger an history-back. Thus the T.O.C. will not get in your
     way when navigating the history later on.

** Keyboard navigation

   + *Easy keyboard navigation* ::
     See Section [[Shortcuts]] for a list of shortcuts.
   + *Customizable features* ::
     All features are customizable simply by setting up your export options
     template (see [[Usage]]).
   + *Folding* ::
     Emulates the way of folding in emacs Org-mode. Mouse supported.

** Searching

   + *Full text-search with highlighting* ::
     Search forward, backwards, repeated search... This is still experimental.
   + *Occur mode* ::
     As experimental as the text-search, but I love this one. You may link to a
     file using this script like this: =index.html?OCCUR=java=
   + *Tags index* ::
     '=C=' shows a table of contents based on tags. Inherited tags are not
     supported yet. This was an [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2008-07/msg00434.html][idea of Rick Moynihan]].

** Miscelaneous

   + *Inter-linking* ::
     The exported pages can be linked to the homepage and an directory index or
     some other sort of parent file.
   + *Adjusted internal links* ::
     Internal links to section headings are automatically adjusted to work with
     this script. When following such internal links, one may go back again
     using '=b='.
   + *Detect the target in the URL* ::
     If the URL is suffixed by '=#sec-x.y.z=' that section will be displayed
     after startup.
   + *Structure is taken from export preferences* ::
     The paging is done according to your setting of
     =org-export-headline-levels=. Scanning the T.O.C. is a good way to get
     around browser detection. An option to hide the T.O.C. exists.
   + *Startup information* ::
     Show a little message on page load to tell the visitor about the script
     usage.
   + *Wrap text before first headline* ::
     This is a temporary fix for the
     missing =<p>= element around the text before the first headline,
     available since version 0.0.7.3a. If you export with =skip:nil=, you
     may add this to your stylesheet:
     :#text-before-first-headline {color:red;font-weight:bold;}


* <<<Shortcuts>>>

  The visitor of this file (and every XHTML-exported org file that includes the
  script) may use the mouse or the following keys to navigate. '=?=' should give
  you a list of shortcuts too.

  The script always tries to keep the last selected section visible. This is
  somewhat strange when scrolling, but really helpfull for keyboard navigation.

  If the keyboard shortcuts work for you, drop me a mail and tell me your
  browser and its version so we can put it on list of [[Supported Browsers][supported browsers]].

  The TOC is handled specially, when hidden. If you press '=i=', the TOC is
  displayed. Any subsequent key press goes back to where you've been before. The
  TOC does not show up the history. Same applies to the keyboard help.

  | Key   | Function                                                   |

  Thanks Carsten, for this beautifull table!

* <<<Setup>>>

  This section describes how to setup your org files to use the
  script. [[Export-Setup - the new Way]] covers setting up org XHTML
  export with Org-mode version >= 6.02. For those using an older
  Org-mode version < 6.02 the next section ([[Export-Setup - the old Way]])
  remains. [[Using Set()]] contains a list of all supported options for adjusting
  the =org\_html\_manager= to suit your needs.

  A reasonably recent org version is available for download on [[http://orgmode.org/#sec-4][orgmode.org]]
  whilst the latest version of the script is in the git repo:

  :git-clone git://github.com/SebastianRose/org-info-js.git

  This script will not work with the XHTML exporter that comes with
  Org-mode in Emacs 22.x.

  The current version of Org-mode was used to produce this XHTML file
  with the new exporter which was revised by Carsten Dominik in March
  2008 (in Org-mode v5.23a+) to better support =XML=.  You can use
  =M-x org-version= to see which version of Org-mode you have
  installed.

  The new XHTML structure won't break any of your stylesheets.

** <<Export-Setup - the new Way>>

   org-info-js now supports the standard Org-mode methods for
   exporting XHTML, and including extra data in the head of the
   exported file.

   The modern way of org export setup provides extra options to include and
   configure the script, as well as a emacs customize interface for this same
   purpose. Options set in customize may be overwritten on a per-file basis
   using one or more special =#+INFOJS_OPT:= lines in the head of your org
   file.

   As an example, the head of this org file looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+INFOJS_OPT: path:org-info.js
#+INFOJS_OPT: toc:nil localtoc:t view:info mouse:underline
#+INFOJS_OPT: up:http://www.legito.net/
#+INFOJS_OPT: home:http://orgmode.org buttons:nil
#+END_SRC

*** Using customize

    To use customize type
    :M-x customize-group RET org-export-html RET
    scroll to the bottom and click =Org Export HTML INFOJS=.

    On this page three main options may be configured. /Org Export Html Use
    Infojs/ is very good documented and /Org Infojs Template/ should be
    perfect by default. So I'll concentrate on /Org Infojs Options/ here.

      + =path= ::
        Absolute or relative URL to the script as used in in XHTML
        links. '=org-info.js=' will find the file in the current
        directory. Keep in mind that this will be the directory of the
        exported file, eventually a directory on a server.

      + =view= ::
        What kind of view mode should the script enter on startup? Possible
        values are
        + =info= --- info view mode,
        + =overview= --- plain view mode, only first level headlines visible,
        + =content= --- plain view mode, all headlines visible,
        + =showall= --- plain view mode showing the entire document.

      + =toc= ::
        Show the table of contents? \\
        Possible values:
        + =t= --- show the toc,
        + =nil= --- hide the toc (only show when '=i=' is pressed),
        + =Publishing/Export property= --- derivate this setting from another
          property like =org-export-with-toc=.

      + =localtoc= ::
        Should the script insert a local table of contents below the headings
        of sections containing subsections? The default is no.\\
        Possible values:
        + =t= --- show the local toc below the first text in a section,
        + =nil= --- hide the toc (only show when '=i=' is pressed). This is
          the default, if this option is omitted.
        + =above= --- sho the toc directly under the sections heading.

      + =mouse= ::
        Highlight the headline under the mouse in plain view mode?
        + =underline= --- underline the headline under mouse,
        + =#dddddd= --- or any valid XHTML/CSS color value like =red= to draw a
          colored background for the headline under the mouse.

      + =runs= ::
        *Obsolete*.
        Number of attempts to scan the document. It's no risk to set this to a
        higher value than the default. The =org_html_manager= will stop as
        soon as the entire document is scanned.

      + =buttons= ::
        Affects plain view mode only.

*** Per File Basis: #+INFOJS\_OPT

    A single file may overwrite the global options using a line like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+INFOJS_OPT: view:info mouse:underline up:index.html home:http://www.mydomain.tpl toc:t
#+END_SRC

    Possible options are the same as in the previous section. Additional (?)
    options include:

    + =home= ::
      An URL to link to the homepage. The text displayed is =HOME=.
    + =up= ::
      An URL pointing to some main page. The text displayed is =Up=.

** <<Export-Setup - the old Way>>

   This section describes the old way to setup the script using the
   =org-export-html-style= configuration. If you own a current version (6.00
   ++) of Org-mode you should better use [[Export-Setup - the new Way]] of setting
   up the export for script usage. You might want to read the sections [[The XHTML]]
   for more information. [[Using Set()]] contains a list of all supported options
   recognised by the script.

*** Using a special * COMMENT Section

    The second possibility to include the script is to add a special section
    to the end of your org file (multiple lines possible):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* COMMENT html style specifications
,# Local Variables:
,# org-export-html-style: "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
,# type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\" />
,# <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"org-info.js\">
,# </script>
,# <script type=\"text/javascript\">
,#  /* <![CDATA[ */
,#    org_html_manager.set(\"LOCAL_TOC\", 1);
,#    org_html_manager.set(\"VIEW_BUTTONS\", \"true\");
,#    org_html_manager.set(\"MOUSE_HINT\", \"underline\");
,#    org_html_manager.setup ();
,#  /* ]]> */
,# </script>"
,# End:
#+END_SRC

      Ensure to precede all the verbatim double quotes with a backslash and
      include the whole value of =org-export-html-style= into double quotes
      itself.

*** Using customize

      One could customize the option '=org-export-html-style=' globaly by
      :M-x cuomize-variable RET org-export-html-style RET
      and set it there.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type="text/javascript" src="org-info.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */
org_html_manager.set("LOCAL_TOC", 1);
org_html_manager.set("VIEW_BUTTONS", "true");
org_html_manager.set("MOUSE_HINT", "underline");
org_html_manager.setup ();
/* ]]> */
</script>
#+END_SRC

      This way all your files will be exported using the script in the future.

*** Export-Setup per Project

      Last but not least and very handy is the possibility to setup the usage of
      the script per project. This is a taylor made passage of the org manual:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      ’(("org"
         :base-directory "~/org/"
         :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
         :section-numbers nil
         :table-of-contents nil
         :style "<link rel=stylesheet href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                type=\"text/css\">
                <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"org-info.js\"></script>
                <script type=\"text/javascript\">
                 /* <![CDATA[ */
                    org_html_manager.setup ();
                 /* ]]> */
                </script>")))
#+END_SRC

      Don't forget to add an export target for the script itself ;-)

* <<Linking to Files using the Script>>

  Just use the ordinary link syntax to link to files that use the script. Append
  the section to the URL if neccessary:

  : http://www.domain.tld/path/to/org.html#sec-3.4

  One may overwrite the author's settings using special suffixes appended to the
  URL of the script. Here are some examples linking to this section and changing
  the intial view mode. Currently only the '/internal/' options are used (see
  [[Using set()]] for a list).

#+BEGIN_HTML
    <ul>
    <li>
    <a href="index.html?TOC=1&amp;VIEW=info#sec-5"><code>index.html?TOC=1&amp;VIEW=info#sec-5</code></a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="index.html?TOC=0&amp;VIEW=overview#sec-5"><code>index.html?TOC=0&amp;VIEW=overview#sec-5</code></a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="index.html?VIEW=content&amp;TOC_DEPTH=1#sec-5"><code>index.html?VIEW=content&amp;TOC_DEPTH=1#sec-5</code></a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="index.html?VIEW=showall&amp;MOUSE_HINT=rgb(255,133,0)#sec-5"><code>index.html?VIEW=showall&amp;MOUSE_HINT=rgb(255,133,0)#sec-5</code></a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="index.html?OCCUR=java"><code><b>index.html?OCCUR=java</b></code></a>
    </li>
    </ul>
#+END_HTML

  *Note* that it is not possible to change the '/HOME/' and '/Up/' links.

  *Note* also that everything but =[0-9a-zA-Z\.-_]= should be URL encoded if used
  as an options value.

* <<CSS>>

  There is currently only one CSS class used in the script. More style classes
  will follow in the future.

  + =org-info-info-navigation= ::
    Style for the navigation table in info view mode. I needed this one to avoid
    border around that table. You may add lines like these to your stylesheet:

#+BEGIN_SRC css
/* Style for org-info.js */

.org-info-js_info-navigation
{
  border-style:none;
}
#org-info-js_console-label
{
  font-size:10px;
  font-weight:bold;
  white-space:nowrap;
}
.org-info-js_search-highlight
{
  background-color:#ffff00;
  color:#000000;
  font-weight:bold;
}
#+END_SRC



* <<Supported Browsers>>

  The functionality of the script is based on =DOM=. This leads to some
  incompatibility with legacy browsers. But hey, it's 2008, isn't it?

  So what browsers are supported then? Well - I don't know for
  sure. JavaScript™ 1.4 plus =DOM= should make
    + Netscape 6.0 and higher
    + Internet Explorer 5.0 and up
    + Firefox 1.0 ++  - 2.0.0.12 and 3.0 Beta tested
    + Opera 7.0 and higher - v.9.26 tested.
    + Safari 1.0

  I have written and tested the script only in current Firefox, Opera and IE 6
  so far for a lack of spare time, operating systems on my laptop, and installed
  browsers. IE is not fully supported (position fixed...) but fairly
  working. Firefox 2 is anyoing slow as with all web pages heavily utilising
  JavaScript. I recently installed Firefox 3.0 Beta which works much better. For
  once in my life I have to admit that Opera is the best here.

** <<People reported it works in>>

   So let's gather the tested Browsers here. Problems are only listed, if they
   are Browser specific. Let me say it again: we don't wont to support legacy
   browsers, do we?

   | Browser           |    Version |
   |-------------------+------------|
   | Opera             |      9.26+ |
   | Firefox/Iceweasel |   2.0.0.12 |
   | Firefox/Iceweasel | 3.0.2 Beta |
   | IE                |        5.5 |
   | IE                |          6 |

   If you manage to get this thingy working in any browser please let us know, so
   we can update the above table.

* <<Why Do I Need a T.O.C?>>

  Currently the script depends on the table of contents in the resulting
  XHTML. The T.O.C. can be hidden though.

  The main reason is the behaviour of browsers. There is no safe way to detect
  if the entire document is loaded at a certain point in time. Opera for example
  returns =true= if we ask it =if(document.body)=. The =init()= function of the
  =OrgHtmlManager= is aware of the possibility, that not even the T.O.C. might
  be loaded when this function is called. Hence it should work for slow
  connections too. There should be tons of other bugs though :)

* <<The XHTML>>

  End users may consider this section obsolete as of org version 6.00-pre-3,
  since there is a new configuration interface in org now to setup the script
  without dealing with JavaScript. It is still here to show the desired look
  of the head section of the XHTML. Also someone might be interested to use the
  script for XHTML files not exported from org.

  The script has to be included in the header of the resulting XHTML files. The
  document structure has to be exactly the one produced by the current XHTML
  export of emacs Org-mode.
  You may pass options to the =org\_html\_manager= by utilising its =set()=
  method. For a list of options see section [[Using Set()]]. This is what the
  head section should look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type="text/javascript" src="org-info.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */
org_html_manager.set("LOCAL_TOC", 1);
org_html_manager.set("TOC", 1);
org_html_manager.set("VIEW_BUTTONS", "1");
org_html_manager.set("MOUSE_HINT", "underline"); // or background-color like '#eeeeee'
org_html_manager.setup ();
/* ]]> */
</script>
#+END_SRC

  To just use the script with the defaults put this into the head section of the
  XHTML files:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type="text/javascript" src="org-info.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */
org_html_manager.setup ();
/* ]]> */
</script>
#+END_SRC

  I recommend the use of

#+BEGIN_SRC html

  which is valid XHTML but not understood by all browsers. I'll use the first
  version throughout this document where ever the space allows to do so.

** <<Using Set()>>

   Before calling
   :org_html_manager.setup ();
   one may configure the script by using the =org_html_manager='s function
   =set(key, val)=. There is one important rule for all of these options. If
   you set a string value containing single quotes, do it this way:
   :org_html_manager.set("key", "value with \\'single quotes\\'");

   + =VIEW= :: Set to a true value to start in textinfo kind of view. Note: you
     could also use =org\_html\_manager.INFO\_VIEW=,
     =org\_html\_manager.PRESENTATION\_VIEW= or
     =org\_html\_manager.PLAIN\_VIEW=. Defaults to plain view mode.
   + =HIDE\_TOC= ::
     If =1=, hide the table of contents.
   + =SUB\_INDEXES= ::
     If set to a =true= (=1= or not empty string) value, create subindexes
     for sections containing subsections. See sections 1 2, or 3.1 of this
     document. The index below the headline (under 'Contents:') is generated
     by the script. This one is off by default.
   + =VIEW\_BUTTONS= ::
     If =true=, include the small '/toggle view/' link above every headline in
     plain view too. The visitor can toggle the view every where in the file
     then. If =false=, only at the top of the file such a link is displayed
     when in plain view. Default is =false=.
   + =MOUSE\_HINT= ::
     Highlight the heading under the mouse. This can be a background color
     (like '=#ff0000=', '=red=' or '=rgb(230,230,230)=') or the keyword
     #'=underline='.
   + =LINK\_UP= ::
     May be set, to link to an other file, preferably the main index page of a
     subdirectory. You might consider using an absolute URL here. This link will be
     displayed as
     :<a href="LINK_UP">Up</a>
     Command: '=h=' - home::
     This way we can link files into a tree, if all subdirectories in the
     project follow the same conventions. Like containing some
     =subdir/index.org= and a homepage somwhere else.
   + =LINK\_HOME= ::
     May be set, to link to an other file, preferably the main home page. You
     must use an absolute URL here. This link will be displayed as
     :<a href="LINK_HOME">Up</a>
     Command: '=H=' - HOME::
     This way we can link files into a tree, if all subdirectories in the
     project follow the same conventions. Like containing some
     =subdir/index.org= and a homepage somwhere else.
   + =TOC\_DEPTH= ::
     Cut the T.O.C. at a certain level. This was done to support big big
     files and was requested by Carsten Dominik. If '=0=' or not provided at
     all the T.O.C. will not be cut. If set to a number greater than '=0=',
     the T.O.C. will cut to only show headlines down to that very level.
   + =HELP= ::
     Display a little message on page load? Defaults to no message. Set to =1=
     to display the startup message.

* How it works

  First of all the script is included  in the header as described in [[Usage]].  The
  document has  to be exported with T.O.C.  since the script depends  on it (See
  [[Why Do I Need a T.O.C?]]).

  When   included,   it   creates    a   global   JavaScript™   variable   named
  =org\_html\_manager=.

  The  =org\_html\_manager::setup()=  function,  that  you  will  have  to  call
  yourself  (see examples in  [[Usage]]), sets  up a  timeout function  calling it's
  =init()= function after  50ms. After those 50 ms  The =init()= function starts
  it's first attempt  to scan the document, using the T.O.C.  as a guide. During
  this scan the  =org\_html\_manager= builds a tree of  nodes, each caching some
  data for later use. Once an element of the document is scanned it is marked by
  setting a property =scanned\_for\_org= to =1=. This way it will not be scanned
  a second time in  subsquent runs (it will be checked though,  but no work will
  be done for it).

  If the document  (or the T.O.C.) is not  entirely loaded, =org\_html\_manager=
  stops  scanning,  sets  the  timeout  again  to start  an  other  scan  50  ms
  later. Once the  entire document is loaded and scanned no  new timeout will be
  set, and the document is displayed in the desired way (hopefully).

  Once the number of attempts to scan the  the document was configurable. This
  was dropped, since we can not know in advance how fast the document will be
  loaded on the client side.

  The =org\_html\_manager= also  changes the document a bit to  make it react on
  certain input  events and follow your  wishes. The old  '/event handling/' was
  entirely based on the normal link functions using so called =accesskeys=. This
  has changed a little, but is  still only in experimental state. The accesskeys
  will stay cause there is no reason to remove them.

  There is still  the idea of a new /emacs like/  keyboard handling to implement
  complex commands (which is still in the far future).

* Presentations with org-info.js

  The script can handle all the sections as single slides. Press '=x=' to switch
  to the presentation mode. In this mode you may navigate the sections using the
  mouse. Currently a single click moves forward and a doubleclick backwards
  (will change this to right mouse button for backwards movement).

  The first plain list (i.e. an <ul> element) in a section is special. The items
  will be shown one by one when moving forward.

  If you're at the end of the presentation, a click does not trigger a
  warning. Same applies to a doubleclick when in the first section.

  There is no plan to extend this feature very much. We plan to write a separate
  tool to handle slides.

* History

  The aim of this little script is to implement a part of emacs Org-mode
  facilities of folding. Oh, no - not originaly.

  My first idea was to view some of my larger org files without scrolling. I
  wanted to have them paged just like texinfo or linuxdoc files. In February
  2008 I came across Carsten Dominiks /ideas/ page
  [[http://orgmode.org/todo.html]]. And I could not resist to write him some of my
  thoughts about this great emacs mode including some little ideas and
  drawbacks. I don't know how, but it somehow these guys made me, lazy bone that
  I am, write this little script as an apetizer of /web 3.0 in Org-mode/ (Phil
  Jackson).

  I did and since some people really liked it, worked a bit more on it and added
  features. Bastien Guerry was so kind to publish it on
  http://www.legito.net/org-info-js/ the first months. Thanks Bastien.

  In the first days of April Carsten Dominik added code to Org-mode to support
  the usage of this script. Hence the script may now be configured in a similar way
  to the other export options. Since then it is even possible to configure this
  script through customize.

* Thanks

  Very special thanks to Carsten Dominik, Bastien Guerry and Phil Jackson who
  have encouraged me to write and publish this little piece of (unfinished) work
  and all the hundrets of hours they spent on this fantastic emacs mode called
  Org-mode and the export modules.

  Org is a new working experience for me and there is nothing comparable to
  working with emacs AND Org-mode.

  An other big kiss to Gabi ([[http://www.emma-stil.de][www.emma-stil.de]]) for being so patient while I was
  not working on our projects but playing with emacs.

  Thanks to Tobias Prinz for listening to my stupid JavaScript questions and all
  the usefull tips. Espacially the negative margin trick and key input.

  And again big thanks to Carsten Dominik for making the inclusion and
  configuration of the script so easy for the users, all the inspired ideas and
  the great org radio table trick. A lot of the power of the final make up is
  your merit! We all love to read the Org-mode mailing lists because of the
  kind and relaxed tone that is yours.

  Thanks a lot for OrgMode!

* License

  What I think about licenses? Well - I think licences and patents are not far
  from each other. Poor people (and poor countries!!!) stay poor because of both
  of them. But since I know where I live, in a world made of licenses and
  patents, I have to apply some license to my work to protect it and stay
  unprotected.

  Hence the script itself is provided under the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html][GPL version 2]]. This document is
  subject to [[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/fdl.txt][GFDL]].

* THE END

  This document in emacs23 with Org-mode v. 5.22a+. The visibilty of the
  contents of a individual section or subsection can be toggled by clicking the
  stars in front of the headlines or moving there and hitting =TAB=. The
  visibility of the entire document structure can be changed by pressing
  =SHIFT+TAB= anywhere. When on a headline, pressing =ALT+UP/DOWN= moves the
  entire subtree to different location in the tree, keeping it's level of
  indentation. =ALT+LEFT/RIGHT= promotes and demotes the subtree.
