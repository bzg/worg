This page contains an illustrated example on how to use the Emacs
customization system to find the right variable for a particular
purpose.  Org-mode contains more than 650 options that can be used to
fine-tune a detail, and it can be daunting to find the right variable
for a particular job - even though more often than not, the variable
does exist.

The [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization][Emacs customize system]] offers a way out.  With this tool,
variables can be grouped and organized into a hierarchical system
that makes it much easier to find the right one.  The best way to
start is to /browse a customization group/.  This can be done with

#+begin_example
M-x customize-browse RET
#+end_example

which enters the top-level group for all of Emacs and lets you drill
down from there.  Org-mode provides a special command to start
directly in the Org group:

#+begin_example
M-x org-customize RET
#+end_example

You can also access this command from the Org menu under =Org ->
Customize -> Brows Org Group=.

* How to change the parameters for the clocktable in the Org-mode Daily Agenda

So here is an example.  In the past, Flavio de Souza [[https://list.orgmode.org/87d4go5x8j.fsf@gmail.com][asked]] on
[[http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode][emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]] how he could change the maximum level for the
construction of the clock table in the Org Daily/Weekly agenda.

Here is the illustrated answer:


1. In an Org-buffer, use the menu to select
   Org -> Customize -> Browse Org Group

    [[file:../images/cd/customize-1.png]]

2. Open the "Org Agenda" group by clicking the "+" in front of it.

    [[file:../images/cd/customize-2.png]]


3. Inside you find another group: "Daily/Weekly Agenda", and in that group
   there is the option "Org Agenda Clockreport Parameter Plist":

    [[file:../images/cd/customize-3.png]]

4. When you select this variable, you are in a customization buffer
   where you can changes the parameters for this option, in your case
   you will set maxlevel to 3.

    [[file:../images/cd/customize-4.png]]

5. After you are done, click on *Set for current section* and then on
   *Save for future sessions* near the top of the buffer.


It may not always be as simple to find the correct variable, but with
some clicking around, you will get there.  And if you find that a
particular variable has a stupid name, or is not in the right group,
