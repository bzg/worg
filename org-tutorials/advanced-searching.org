* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: introduction
  :END:

Org-mode has many powerful built-in search functions. These tools
transform hierarchical org files into robust plain text "databases"
that can be queried in sophisticated ways. Outline headings in
Org-mode not only function as document sections or todo items; each
heading can also store an unlimited amount of text and various types
of metadata. And, of course, since Org-mode files are plain text, any
number of tools (grep, awk, perl, etc.) can be used to filter and
manipulate the data they contain.

The goal of this tutorial is to offer an introduction to the built-in
commands and syntax for querying Org-mode outlines. While these are
explained in various places in the Org-mode manual, this tutorial
attempts to provide an overview in one place. It is particularly aimed
at those who would like to use Org-mode as a note-taking and reference
management tool. Nonetheless, it should prove useful to anyone who
needs to locate specific information buried in an ever-growing
collection of Org-mode data.

* Outline nodes as "data containers"
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: outline-nodes-as-data-containers
  :END:

Before discussing specific search commands, it is worth taking a few
moments to consider the basic structure of an Org-mode entry.

Though outline entries can be nested within one another
hierarchically, each node is also a discrete container of data.
Indeed, a large variety of metadata---a todo keyword, tags,
timestamps, logging information, and properties (i.e., arbitrary data
pairs)---can be attached to each heading. Similarly each outline entry
can store an unlimited amount of text. 

Here is an example:

#+begin_src org
  ,* TODO Buy clothes for wedding                    :wedding:important:errands:
  ,  SCHEDULED: <2010-12-01 Wed>
  ,  :PROPERTIES:
  ,  :estimated-cost: 100
  ,  :END:
  ,  [2010-11-17 Wed 12:22]
  
  ,  I need to look spiffy for the big day!
  
  ,   - [ ] Suit
  ,   - [ ] Tie
  ,   - [ ] Shoes
  ,   - [ ] Hat
  
  ,  Possible stores to visit:
  ,  
  ,  | Store           | Location               | Miles away |
  ,  |-----------------+------------------------+------------|
  ,  | The Suit King   | 1000 E. Washington St. |        5.1 |
  ,  | Mr. Haberdasher | 259 Western Rd.        |        7.2 |
  
#+end_src

The sample entry above has the following metadata:

 - todo keyword :: TODO
 - scheduled timestamp :: 2010-12-01 Wed
 - inactive timestamp :: 2010-11-17 Wed 12:22
 - property :: estimated-cost \Rightarrow 100
 - tags :: "wedding", "important", and "errands"

The entry also contains some text, including a checklist and a table.

Normally, an Org-mode file/outline contains several entries such as
the one above, nested hierarchically. Moreover, Org users typically
make their most important files available for easy searching by adding
them to their list of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-files.html#Agenda-files][agenda files]], either selecting them one-by-one
with =C-c [= or by setting the variable =org-agenda-files=.

* The agenda as a search engine
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: agenda-as-search-engine
  :END:

For querying a collection of org files, Org-mode includes a powerful
built-in search-engine, [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-views.html#Agenda-views][the agenda]] (=C-c a=). As its name suggests,
the most common use of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-views.html#Agenda-views][the agenda]] is to pull together, from all the
agenda files, a daily or weekly schedule or a list of todos. But the
agenda is also a powerful search engine that offers various ways tools
for querying both the metadata and the text of org-mode entries. In
fact, Org-mode's default agenda view (=C-c a a= or =org-agenda-list=)
is simply a search tool that gathers and displays all org-mode entries
with certain types of metadata---timestamps that fall within a given
range of dates.

Typing =C-c a= or =M-x org-agenda= brings up the agenda dispatcher, an
overview of Org-mode's various search tools:

: Press key for an agenda command:        <   Buffer, subtree/region restriction
: --------------------------------        >   Remove restriction
: a   Agenda for current week or day      e   Export agenda views
: t   List of all TODO entries            T   Entries with special TODO kwd
: m   Match a TAGS/PROP/TODO query        M   Like m, but only TODO entries
: L   Timeline for current buffer         #   List stuck projects (!=configure)
: s   Search for keywords                 C   Configure custom agenda commands
: /   Multi-occur                         ?   Find :FLAGGED: entries

A quick perusal of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-agenda-views.html#Built_002din-agenda-views][the commands]] here reveals that one can query for a
wide variety of data. This tutorial will focus on three searches in
particular:

 - =C-c a T= :: for todo keywords
 - =C-c a m=  :: for tags and properties
 - =C-c a s= :: for full text searches

Now, let's look at the syntax for each of these search tools.

* Searching metadata (todos, tags, and properties)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: searching-metadata
  :END:
** Todo keyword searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: todo-keyword-searches
   :END:

The simplest type of metadata query in org-mode is [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Global-TODO-list.html#Global-TODO-list][=org-todo-list=]]
(invoked with =C-c a T=). This function prompts the user for a search
string and then retrieves a list of outline headings containing the
TODOs specified in the search string.[fn:lowercase-t]

Since each outline heading can contain only one TODO keyword, the
search syntax is quite simple, consisting either of a single keyword
or two or more keywords bound together by the boolean operator =|=
("or").

For instance, the following query...

: TODO

...retrieves all entries marked with a TODO keyword, whereas...

: TODO|PROJECT|MAYBE

...displays a list of all headlines containing either TODO or PROJECT
or MAYBE.

[fn:lowercase-t] Note that the lowercase variant of the command (=C-c
a t=) does not provide a search prompt, but simply pulls up all active
TODOs.

** Tag searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: tag-searches
   :END:
#+INDEX: tags
#+INDEX: search!tags

Though the org-todo-list serves its purpose well, it is limited to
only one type of metadata. If you would like to search for other types
of metadata, or mix and match a search for todo keywords with, say, a
search for tags, org-mode offers a more powerful tool,
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html#Matching-tags-and-properties][=org-tags-view=]], which is called with the following keys:

   - =C-c a m= :: searches all headlines
   - =C-c a M= :: searches only headlines with active todos

At its simplest, org-tags-view does exactly what it says: it queries
for headlines marked with particular combinations of tags. The syntax
for such searches follows a simple boolean logic:

 - =|= :: or
 - =&= :: and
 - =+= :: include matches
 - =-= :: exclude matches

Here are a few examples:

1. =+computer&+urgent=

   ...will result in all items tagged both computer *and* urgent,
   while the search...

2. =+computer|+urgent=

   ...will result in all items tagged *either* computer *or* urgent.
   Meanwhile, the query...

3. =+computer&-urgent=

   ...will display all items tagged computer *and not* urgent.

As you may have noticed, the syntax above can be a little verbose, so
org-mode offers convenient ways of shortening it. First, =-= and =+=
imply "and" if no boolean operator is stated, so example three above
could be rewritten simply as:

: +computer-urgent

Second, inclusion of matches is implied if no =+= or =-= is present,
so example three could be further shortened to:

: computer-urgent

Example number two, meanwhile, could be shortened to:

: computer|urgent

*** Grouping tags
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: grouping-tags
    :END:

There is no way (as yet) to express search grouping with parentheses.
The "and" operators (=&=, =+=, and =-=) always bind terms together
more strongly than "or" (=|=). For instance, the following search...

: computer|work+email

...results in all headlines tagged either with "computer" or both
"work" and "email". An expression such as =(computer|work)&email= is
*not* supported at the moment.

There, are, however several other ways to achieve the grouping effect
of parentheses:

1. Use a regular expression

   To invoke the "grouping" logic of parentheses, you can construct a
   regular expression:

   : +{computer\|work}+email

   Note: you can also use the special property =ALLTAGS= (which
   queries the same data as a normal tags search) together with a
   regular expression:

   : ALLTAGS={computer\|work}+email
   
   (In the next section we'll learn more about how property searches
   and regular expressions are constructed.)

2. Use a slightly more verbose query as a substitute for the logic of
   parentheses. E.g.,

   : computer&email|work&email

   This search will match all headlines tagged either with "computer"
   and "email" or with "work" and "email."

3. If you are combining a tags search with a TODO search, you can use
   the following:

   : computer|email/!NOW

4. Use [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-commands.html#Agenda-commands][agenda filtering]].

   Simply search for all headlines tagged with "computer" or "work"
   and then use the agenda's tag filtering capabilities (=/=) to see
   only those headlines among the results that have the tag "email."

** Property searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: property-searches
   :END:

Org-mode allows outline entries to contain any number of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Properties-and-columns.html#Properties-and-columns][arbitrary
data pairs]], which are conveniently hidden within a folding PROPERTIES
drawer, e.g.:

#+begin_src org
  ,* TODO Evensong's magisterial work on the Amazon           :science:read:BIB:
  ,  SCHEDULED: <2010-11-20 Sat>
  ,  [2010-11-16 Tue 23:11]
  ,  :PROPERTIES:
  ,  :BIB_AUTHOR: Walter Evensong
  ,  :BIB_TITLE: Mysteries of the Amazon
  ,  :BIB_PAGES: 1234
  ,  :BIB_PUBLISHER: Humbug University Press
  ,  :END:
  ,  
  ,  Lots of good stuff on Brazil.
#+end_src

Let's imagine a free software aficionado named Mr. Gnu has added a
number of similar bibliographical outline nodes to his org files and
that he would like to find all entries that contain "Walter Evensong"
in their =BIB_AUTHOR= field. He can construct such a search so by
calling =org-tags-view= and entering the desired key/value match:

: C-c a m 
: Match: BIB_AUTHOR="Walter Evensong"

Property searches can be mixed and matched with tag searches. If Mr.
Gnu would like to see all books by "Walter Evensong" with the tag
"read", he can simply join the two desired matches together with the
=+= sign:

: BIB_AUTHOR="Walter Evensong"+read

Properties with numeric values can be queried with inequalities. If
Mr. Gnu would like to retrieve all books by the prolific Walter
Evensong that span over 1000 pages, he could enter the following:

: BIB_AUTHOR="Walter Evensong"+BIB_PAGES>1000

The comparison operators for searches are as follows:

: = (equal), > (greater than), <= (greater than or equal to), 
: < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), <> (not equal)

What if Mr. Gnus would to like of find all books by Walter Evensong
*or* any books over 1000 pages?

: BIB_AUTHOR="Walter Evensong"|BIB_PAGES>1000

For his own clarity, Mr. Gnu can always insert "+" signs, though they
are not required:

: +BIB_AUTHOR="Walter Evensong"|+BIB_PAGES>1000

It is important to note that the equal sign in the searches above
implies an exact match. If Mr. Gnu is searching for a string, such as
"Mysteries of the Amazon", the entire search query must match. Thus,
the search...

: BIB_TITLE="Amazon"

...will not match the entry above. 

How then can you search for partial matches? The answer is regular
expressions. Instead of surrounding your query with quotation marks
(which will necessitate a precise and complete match), you can instead
enfold it in brackets, which instructs Org-mode to treat the query as
a regular expression. Thus, the search...

: BIB_TITLE={Amazon}

...will locate all entries that match contain the sequence "Amazon"
and pull them up in the agenda:

: Headlines with TAGS match: BIB_TITLE={Amazon}
: Press `C-u r' to search again with new search string
:  org:        TODO Evensong's magisterial work on the Amazon  :science:read:BIB:

Mr. Gnu jots down the following rule in his growing org file collection:

#+begin_src org
  ,* Tags/property search matching
  , - For exact matches, use quotation marks.
  , - For partial matches, use curly brackets.
#+end_src

[[http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions][Regular expressions]] allow for more flexible searches. Let's say that
for some strange reason Mr. Gnu would like to find all books
containing either "Amazon" or "Amazing" in their titles. The following
regular expression search should do the trick:

: BIB_TITLE={Amaz\(on\|ing\)}

Let's break this expression down:

 - =Amaz= :: This is the string shared by both words.
 - =\(...\)= :: These parentheses create a grouping to set off the
              alternative matches that follow "Amaz".
 - =on\|ing= :: =\|= is the "or" expression. Since it is placed within
              the parentheses, it means that a match must begin with
              "Amaz" but can end *either* in "on" *or* "ing".

You may be wondering why the search query contains so many
backslashes. It is because Emacs' regular expression engine gives the
characters =(=, =)=, and =|= a special meaning only when they are
"escaped" (i.e., preceded by a backslash). Thus, Mr. Gnu had simply
typed =BIB_TITLE={Amaz(on|ing)}=, he would have instructed Org-mode to
match entries with the exact sequence =Amaz(on|ing)= (an unlikely
match, unless he has a large collection of literary theory from the
1990s).
              
Here's a simpler example. If Mr. Gnu would like to find all entries
with either "Walter" or "Evensong" in the author field, he could type:

: BIB_TITLE={Walter\|Evensong}

If he would like to pull up all entries that have defined value for
the =BIB_TITLE= property, he can simply use a single dot to match any
character:

: BIB_TITLE={.}

** Special Properties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: special-properties
   :END:

In addition to any explicitly declared key/value property pairs, each
Org-mode entry also has a number of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-properties.html#Special-properties][special (i.e., implicit)
properties]] that can be queried with =org-tags-view= (=C-c a m=). These
include, among other things, the entry's TODO state, tags (local and
inherited), category, priority, and timestamps (DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
active, and inactive). See the [[#outline-nodes-as-data-containers][sample entry]] above for an illustration
of where these properties are typically found in an outline node.

To see all of the properties (both explicit and implicit) defined for
an Org-mode entry, place the following text in an org-mode entry and
evaluate it by typing C-x C-e after the closing parenthesis:

: (org-entry-properties nil)

Here's an example of how such "special properties" can be put to good
use in a search:

: C-c a m
: Match: Effort>1+PRIORITY="A"+SCHEDULED<"<tomorrow>"+ALLTAGS={computer\|email}

This query finds all items with:

1. An estimated effort greater than one hour
2. A priority of "A"
3. A scheduled date "less than" tomorrow (i.e., today or earlier).
4. Either the tag "computer" or the tag "email"
   - Note: the ALLTAGS property includes inherited tags, while the
     TAGS property includes only local tags.
   - This search is also a good example of how to achieve a [[#grouping-tags][grouping
     logic without parentheses]] while querying tags.

Please [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html][consult the manual]] for a fuller explanation of the syntax of
such searches.

*** Querying timestamps
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: querying-timestamps
    :END:

A few words should be said here about querying timestamps contained in
the following properties: =DEADLINE=, =SCHEDULED=, =TIMESTAMP= (the
first active timestamp in an entry), and =TIMESTAMP_IA= (the first
inactive timestamp in an entry).

The basic syntax for querying timestamps is a time string enclosed in
double quotes and angular brackets. E.g., the search...

: C-c a m
: Match: +SCHEDULED="<2010-08-20 Sat>"

...will find all items scheduled for Saturday, August 20, 2010
*without* a time of day specification. This last caveat is important
to note: if you have a timestamp with time of day information, such
as...

#+begin_src org
  ,* Some task
  ,  SCHEDULED: <2010-08-20-Sat 10:30>
#+end_src

...the search above will not retrieve it. (This is not normally a
problem, since the daily/weekly agenda view provides a far superior
mechanism for viewing all timestamps that fall on a particular day.)

The true value of timestamp property queries lies in the use of
inequalities to capture a range of dates. To assist with this task,
Org-mode provides a number of convenient shortcuts:

 - =<today>= and =<tomorrow>= :: timestamps for today and tomorrow
      (without a time of day specification)
 - =<now>= :: right now, including time of day
   - e.g., =2010-11-20 Sat 12:42=
 - =<-5d>=, =<-10w>=, =<+3m>=, =<+1y>= :: relative date indicators
    - the shortcuts above indicate five days ago, ten weeks ago, three
      months from now, and one year from now

To see all items SCHEDULED far in the future, say, more than a year
from now, you could type:

: C-c a m
: Match: SCHEDULED>"<+1y>"

Here's another scenario. Imagine you use org-capture to take all your
notes and that you automatically stamp each notes with an inactive
timestamp. To find all notes you took in the past two weeks with the
tag "chimpanzees", you could perform the following search:

: C-c a m
: Match: chimpanzees+TIMESTAMP_IA>="<-2w>"

*** Limit tags and properties searches by TODO state
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: limiting-searches-to-todos
    :END:

You can limit any of these tags/property searches to active todo
states simply by using =C-c a M= instead of =C-c a m=.

You can also, of course, limit the searches to a particular todo
keyword (say, NEXT) by adding...

: +TODO="NEXT"

...to any of the searches above. But Org-mode also provides a
convenient (and more efficient) syntax for limiting searches to
particular TODO keywords. Simply add a =/= followed by a TODO search
in the form [[#todo-keyword-searches][we've already discussed]]. For instance, to limit the
chimpanzee search above to items marked DONE, you could type:

: C-c a m
: Match: chimpanzees+TIMESTAMP_IA>="<-2w>"/DONE

As with normal todo searches, you can use or (=|=) to expand the
allowed matches. For instance, the query...

: chimpanzees+TIMESTAMP_IA>="<-2w>"/TODO|NEXT

...will match against items marked either TODO or NEXT.

If you are matching only against active todos (i.e., things not marked
done), you can make your search more efficient by adding an exclamation
point. E.g., the following search...

: computer/!TODO|NEXT

...will result in all items tagged "computer" and either a TODO or
NEXT keyword. The exclamation mark will speed up the search, because
org-mode will only query items that have an active todo keyword (as
defined either in the variable =org-todo-keywords= or in =#+TODO=
declarations at the top of an org file). For instance, if you had
placed the following line at the top of your org files...

: #+TODO: TODO NEXT STARTED WAITING | DONE CANCELED

...an exclamation point limit the possible matches items marked TODO,
NEXT, STARTED, or WAITING.

You can use a a negative (=-=) to exclude TODO states. The search...

: computer/!-WAITING

...will result only in items marked TODO, NEXT, or STARTED.

Be careful to avoid using "and" logic when you query TODOs, since each
item, by definition can have only one TODO state. Take a look at the
following two searches:

: computer/!WAITING+TODO

: chimpanzees+TODO="TODO"+SCHEDULED<="<+1w>"+TODO="WAITING"

These searches will *never* return any positive results, since an org
entry cannot have both a TODO *and* a WAITING keyword.

* Searching the full text of entries
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: searching-entry-text
  :END:
** Keyword searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: keyword-searches
   :END:

Thus far, we have explored different ways to query the various types
of metadata attached to an org entry. But what if you would like to
search the entire text of your org entries?

The answer: call [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Search-view.html#Search-view][=org-search-view=]] with =C-c a s=. In the agenda
dispatcher, this appears as...

: s  Search for keywords

Don't be fooled by the word "keywords," which some programs use as a
synonym for tags. Here, a keyword search scours the full text of org
entries.

Let's start with an example:

Desperately in need of typing practice (as if Emacs does not provide
enough keyboarding practice), our friend Mr. Gnu would like to locate
the following entry, which is buried somewhere in his agenda files:

#+begin_src org
  ,* A sentence to test my keyboarding skills
  
  ,The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
#+end_src

Mr. Gnu vaguely remembers that the entry contains the word "fox", so
he pecks at the keyboard to enter...

: C-c a s 

He is confronted with the prompt...

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: 

...so he enters...

: fox

...and receives an agenda buffer with the correct results:

: Search words: fox
: Press `[', `]' to add/sub word, `{', `}' to add/sub regexp, `C-u r' to edit
:  typing:        A sentence to test my keyboarding skills

Here, we should note that Org-mode's keyword searches are
*case-insensitive*, so "fox" will match any of the following: "fox",
"Fox", "FOX", etc.

Let's say, however, that Mr. Gnu's day job involves studying the
behavior of foxes, so he knows ahead of time that a simple search will
bring up hundreds of results. In addition, he recalls that the desired
entry also contains the word "dog". Thus, he enters the following:

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: fox dog

Somewhat puzzlingly, Mr. Gnu's search yields no results. What went
wrong?

Mr. Gnu consults [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Search-view.html#Search-view][the manual]] and finds that the default behavior of
=org-search-view= is to treat the entered query as a single string, so
when he typed =fox dog=, Org-mode looked quite literally for
=fox[whitespace]dog=.

Mr. Gnu further finds that to treat "dog" and "fox" as boolean
keywords that can be located anywhere in the entry, he needs to
precede each term with a =+=. (Technically, he only needs to precede
the first search term with =+= to initiate a boolean search, but he
decides to put =+= in front of both for the sake of clarity.) So he
types...

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +fox +dog

...and is overjoyed to retrieve the expected results.

Mr. Gnu makes a mental note: unless the first character of the search
query is a =+=, Org-mode will treat the entire query as a single
string. Thus, the query...

: fox +dog

...will prompt Org-mode to search for the single string "fox +dog".
(To change this behavior, please read the
[[#boolean-searches-by-default][section for "Google addicts" below]].)

Later, while at work, Mr. Gnu  wants to find all entries on foxes that
do not contain the word dog, so he types...

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +fox -dog

If Mr. Gnu wants to incorporate a substring/phrase into a boolean
search (i.e., a query with a =+= at the beginning), he can use
quotation marks:

: +fox +"lazy dog"

At home again, while practicing typing, Mr. Gnu wants to find all
entries that contain either the word "keyboarding" or the word
"typing". Remember his lessons on tag searches, he tries the following
search query:

: +keyboarding|+typing

Alas, the search returns no results, because Mr. Gnu just instructed
Org-mode to look for the entire string "keyboarding|+typing." Reading
the manual, Mr. Gnu discovers that, unlike todo and tag searches,
keyword searches require separate terms to be separated by whitespace
(e.g., =+fox +dog=). In addition, Mr. Gnus realizes that keyword
searches have only two simple boolean expressions: =+= ("and") and =-=
("and not"). There is no "or" symbol, such as =|=. What then should
Mr. Gnu do to find entries containing keyboarding *or* typing?

** Full text search using regular expressions 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: regexps-in-org-search-view
   :END:

The solution to Mr. Gnu's puzzle is found in regular expressions.
Indeed, Mr. Gnu deduced as much by glancing at the org-search-view
prompt:

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...:

As the prompt suggests, Mr. Gnu can search org-entries using Emacs'
powerful regular expression engine. To do so, he simply needs to
enclose the regular expression in brackets. So he types...

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +{keyboarding\|typing}

...to find all entries that contain either "keyboarding" or "typing".
(Mr. Gnu could also have used parentheses to create a more compact
search query, such as =+{\(keyboard\|typ\)ing}=. Also, it is good to
recall here that =(=, =|=, and =)= only become special characters only
when escaped with a =\=.)

Regular expressions, Mr. Gnu finds, can be combined with words. The
query...

: +{keyboarding\|typing} +fox


...finds the "quick brown fox" entry above, while...


: +{keyboarding\|typing} -fox

...excludes it, finding only those entries that contain either the
word "keyboarding" or "typing" and *not* the word dog.

Again, Org-mode's default behavior is to treat the entire query as a
single string unless it sees a =+= or a ={= at the beginning of the
line. So if Mr. Gnus types...

: dog +{keyboarding\|typing} 

...Org-mode will search for the entire substring "dog
+{keyboarding\|typing}". (If you don't like this behavior, please read

*** Regular expression syntax
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: regular-expression-syntax
    :END:

The possibilities afforded by regular expressions are myriad. The
examples discussed here are relatively basic. For a thorough
introduction to regular expression syntax, please consult the [[http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-of-Regexps.html#Syntax-of-Regexps][emacs
lisp manual]].

Let's look at a couple of examples:

Imagine you've entered a lot of contact entries with phone numbers in
the conventional U.S. format: 123-456-6789. To find all Org-mode
entries with such numbers, you could type:

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +{[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}}

The square brackets here are special characters; they match any of
characters they enclose. For instance, =[abc]= matches either a or b
or c. In this particular case, the =[0-9]= matches any digit between 0
and 9. In addition, the escaped curly brackets (=\{...\}=) that
immediate follow the square brackets indicate how many times in a row
the character should occur. In this case, Org-mode will search for
the following sequence:

  - exactly three digits
  - a hyphen
  - exactly three digits
  - a hyphen
  - exactly four digits

Instead of specifying the precise number of times a match such as
=[0-9]= must repeat, you can also use the following special
characters:

 - =*= :: match any number of times (including none)
 - =+= :: match at least once and possibly more
 - =?= :: match either once or not at all

Now, imagine our friend Mr. Gnu is a new fan of Org-mode and has
jotted down a lot of notes on his favorite PIM. However, he have
entered the name Org-mode inconsistently, sometimes as "orgmode",
other times as "Org mode", and still other times as "Org-mode". He'd
like to find all his references to Org-mode, taking into account the
various spellings. Here's a simple query that will accomplish this:

: +{org[-\s]?mode}

Mr. Gnu just instructed Org-mode to search for any entry that contains
the character sequence "org", followed by a hyphen, a space, or no
character, followed by "mode". Since the search is case-insensitive,
it will match "org-mode", "org mode", or "orgmode".

** Limiting full text searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: limiting-full-text-searches
   :END:

There are several convenient ways to refine and limit full text
searches.

First, if you find that a search produces too many results, you can
easily add a new word or regexp by typing any of the following in the
agenda buffer:

 - =[= :: add a word (i.e., =+=)
 - =]= :: exclude a word (i.e., =-=)
 - ={= :: add a regexp (i.e., =+{}=)
 - =}= :: exclude a regexp (i.e., =-{}=)

Let's say Mr. Gnu searches for the words Carsten *and* Dominik:

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +Carsten +Dominik

Since Mr. Gnu is an avid reader of the Org-mode mailing list and a
heavy user of org-capture, he discovers that he has hundreds of
entries that include Carsten's name. He wants to limit the search only
to entries with an inactive timestamp from November of 2010. So he
types =[= in the agenda buffer to add a new search term and receives the
following prompt...

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +Carsten +Dominik +

...with the cursor conveniently located after the plus sign. He
completes the query to find inactive timestamps from November...


: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +Carsten +Dominik +[2010-11-

...and voilà, he retrieves a smaller subset of results.

If Mr. Gnu wants to find both active and inactive timestamps, he could
instead type ={= to add a regular expression:

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +Carsten +Dominik +{[\[<]2010-11-}

Similarly, if Mr. Gnu wants to guarantee the precision of his match,
he could use a detailed regular expression...

: +{\[2010-11-[0-9]\{2\}\s-[A-Za-z]\{3\}\(\s-[0-9]\{2\}:[0-9]\{2\}\)?\]}

But Mr. Gnu quickly decides that searching for the string "[2010-11-"
good enough for his purposes.

Org-mode also provides convenient syntax for limiting full text
searches.

1. If you place an asterisk at the beginning of your search, Org-mode
   will search only headlines (and not entry text). E.g., to find all
   entries with "emacs" in the headline, you could type:

   : C-c a s
   : [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: *+emacs

2. If you place an exclamation mark at the beginning of the query,
   Org-mode will only pull up entries that are active todos:

   : !+emacs

   (You can also limit your search to active todos by using a prefix
   argument: =C-u C-c a s=.)

3. Finally, if you place a colon at the beginning of a query, the
   boolean words you provide will only match entire words. Thus the
   following search...

   : :+emacs

   ...will match "emacs" but not "emacswiki".

You can mix and match these three limiting symbols, but they will only
work if they appear in the correct order: i.e., =*= -> =!= -> =:=. If
you type =:!+emacs=, your search will not retrieve any results.

** Combining metadata and full text queries
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: combining-metadata-and-full-text-queries
   :END:

As an expert on tag and property searches, you might ask: is it
possible to combine metadata and full text searches? For instance, how
could Mr. Gnu find all entries with "Walter Evensong" in the
=BIB_AUTHOR= field, the todo keyword "DONE", and the word "Brazil" in
the full text of the entry?

- It is not possible to simply combine the syntax of metadata and
  full text searches. Org-mode parses each query in fundamentally
  different ways.

- You can, however, easily accomplish "mixed" queries by using regular
  expressions and =org-search-view=. In some instances,
  =org-search-view= offers an easier and more efficient way of
  querying metadata than the tags and property search.

The simplest way to think about Org-mode metadata is as different
types of markup patterns. Tags are enclosed in colons, todo keywords
directly follow the asterisks that mark outline headings, timestamps
are contained in brackets and have the pattern =YYYY-MM-DD DOW HH:MM=,
and so on. Thus, to query for particular types of metadata, one simply
has to construct regular expressions that match these patterns.

Back to Mr. Gnu, our mediocre typist and reader of very long books.
Today, he would like to find all entries in which:

 - the =BIB_AUTHOR= is "Walter Evensong"
 - the todo keyword is "DONE"
 - the word "Brazil" appears in the full text. 

First, he invokes =org-search-view=:

: C-c a s

At the prompt, he adds a plus sign and the word "brazil":

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +brazil

He remembers that he must add the plus sign to instruct Org-mode to
treat this search as a boolean search. Otherwise it will simply look
for the entire string entered at the prompt.

Next he needs to search for the todo keyword "DONE". Since todo
keywords immediately follow the markup for outline headings, he can
simply add a regexp that matches an outline heading immediately
followed by the word DONE:

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +brazil +{^\*+\s-+DONE\s-}

This regexp begins with =^=, which forces a match at the beginning of
the line. It is followed by an asterisk, which needs to be escaped,
since an asterisk a special character in regular expressions. the =+=
after the asterisk instructs Org-mode to look for one or more
asterisks, while the =\s-+= indicates that at least one space follows
the asterisk(s). So Mr. Gnu is searching for at least one asterisk at
the beginning of the line followed by a space---the very definition of
an outline heading in Org-mode. And the keyword DONE followed by
whitespace completes the match. If Mr. Gnu would like to match more
than one todo keyword, say DONE or WAITING, he could use grouping:
=+{^\*+\s-+\(DONE\|WAITING\)\s-}=

Finally, Mr. Gnu finishes his query by searching for the property
=BIB_AUTHOR=. He recalls that a property line looks like this:

: :BIB_AUTHOR: Walter Evensong

With this in mind, he can easily construct a regexp to search for the
string =:BIB_AUTHOR:= followed by an arbitrary amount of whitespace
followed in turn by the string "Walter Evensong".

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +brazil +{^\*+\s-+DONE\s-} +{:BIB_AUTHOR:\s-+Walter Evensong}

Mr. Gnu is surprised at the speed with which Org-mode returns his
results. Indeed, he finds that regexp searches (especially those
querying properties) usually return their results more quickly than
property and tag searches. And he deduces the reason: whereas property
searches have to query each headline to determine whether a given
property contains a value, keyword searches simply scan each file for
matches and then return the appropriate headlines.

In many instances, of course, the DONE regexp above may be overkill.
Searching for the string "* DONE" will often do the trick. E.g.,

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +brazil +"* DONE"

Indeed, Mr. Gnu could probably also dispense with the =:BIB_AUTHOR:=
regexp above, simply typing...

: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: +brazil +"* DONE" +":BIB_AUTHOR: Walter Evensong"

Here's another example. Let's say Mr. Gnu would like to find all
active todos directly tagged "urgent" (i.e., not inherited) with the
word "wedding" somewhere in the entry text. The following keyword
search does the trick:

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: !+wedding :urgent:

If Mr. Gnu wants to see either the tag "urgent" or the tag
"important", he could use a regular expression:

: !+wedding +{:\(urgent\|important\):}

The main limitation of such searches is that keyword searches know
nothing of outline tree inheritance. Thus, if Mr. Gnu is interested in
all entries that inherit the tag "urgent", he should always use
=org-tags-view=.

** Searching additional files
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: searching-additional-files
   :END:

Often, the set of files one would like to search by keyword is larger
than one's set of active agenda files. For instance, one might archive
old projects in separate files so that they no longer contribute to
the agenda. Yet one would still like to search the reference material
in these projects by keyword/regexp.

The solution lies in the variable
=org-agenda-text-search-extra-files=. Adding a list of files to this
variable instructs =org-search-view= to query those files in addition
to the agenda files. Note that setting
=org-agenda-text-search-extra-files= has no effect on other types of
agenda commands, such as todo and tags/property searches.

** Keyword searches for Google addicts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: boolean-searches-by-default
   :END:

As noted before, =org-search-view= will treat a search query as a
boolean expression only if it begins with either a =+= or a ={= (i.e.,
a regular expression). Without these characters, Org-mode will treat
the query as a single substring.

This default syntax of =org-search-view= is thus different than the
behavior of search engines such as Google, which treat searches as
lazy boolean queries by default. If you type "emacs org-mode" into
Google, it will not search for the literal string "emacs org-mode",
but rather assume the space implies a boolean expression: "emacs and
org-mode".

If you find yourself often forgetting to add an initial =+= to your
=org-search-view= queries, you can make "lazy booleans" the default
behavior by adding the following to your .emacs:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean t)
#+end_src

Then you can happily type your lazy searches:

: C-c a s
: [+-]Word/{Regexp} ...: org mode Carsten :email:

If you would like to include a substring or phrase in your search, you
can do so by enclosing it in quotation marks. And if you want to
exclude items or use regular expressions, you will, of course, still
have to use a minus sign and curly brackets, respectively.

* Searching org files line-by-line
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: line-by-line-search
  :END:

All the searches we have discussed thus far return their results as a
list of org headlines in the agenda buffer. Sometimes, however, you
might prefer to see each line in which a word or regular expression
occurs. There are different ways to do this:

** Multi-occur
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: multi-occur
   :END:

Org-mode uses Emacs' multi-occur command to search for any lines in
the agenda files containing a regular expression. Simply type =C-c a
/= followed by a word or regular expression and you will be presented
a buffer with all lines that match the query, with each line
conveniently linked to its original location.

** External commands and scripts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: grep-etc
   :END:

Emacs provides convenient interfaces to common Unix search commands,
such as grep. Simply type =M-x grep= and complete the query (the
working directory is usually that of the current buffer in Emacs).
Using grep is especially convenient when you want quickly to search
org files that are not in =org-agenda-files= or
=org-agenda-text-search-extra-files=. And, of course, grep can be used
outside of Emacs.

Since org-mode files are plain text, you can use your favorite
scripting language (perl, awk, python, etc.) to develop new and ever
more creative ways to search and analyze them.

* Sparse trees
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sparse-tree-view
  :END:

The commands we have examined so far typically search multiple files
and display the resulting heading in a separate agenda buffer. But
sometimes, you might want to search for various types of data within a
single file, so as to see all the matching headlines and entries in
context.

The way to accomplish this is via a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Sparse-trees.html#Sparse-trees][sparse tree view]] (=C-c /=), which
collapses the outline in the current file, showing only the portions
that match a query.

Calling =org-sparse-tree= with =C-c /= brings up a prompt with several
search options:

: Sparse tree: [r]egexp [/]regexp [t]odo [T]odo-kwd [m]atch [p]roperty
:              [d]eadlines [b]efore-date [a]fter-date

Some of these search, such as "todo" (=t=) and "deadlines" (=d=) are
quite simple, showing all headlines in a buffer that contain an active
todo keyword or a deadline, respectively. Others, such as "property"
(=p=), prompt for a single key/value pair.

One search that may be of particular interest is "match" (=m=). This
query uses exactly the same syntax as =org-tags-view=, allowing us to
use complex metadata searches to create sparse trees

For instance, to highlight all active todos *without* a timestamp in
the current buffer, you could type:

: C-c / m 
: Match: -SCHEDULED={.}/!

This instructs Org-mode to look for any active todo (=/!=) without a
SCHEDULED timestamp.

* Custom agenda commands
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: custom-agenda-commands
  :END:

If there are searches you perform again and again, you can easily save
them by adding them to you [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Custom-agenda-views.html#Custom-agenda-views][custom agenda commands]].

As we know, Mr. Gnu is an avid collector of very large books (which,
of course, he manages in very long org files). Moreover, he often
likes to peruse your inventory of books over 1,000 pages, querying his
custom =BIB_PAGES= field. To save time and energy, Mr. Gnu could add a
custom command such as the following to his =.emacs=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
               '("b" "Big books" tags "+BIB_PAGES>1000"))
#+end_src

Note that "tags" here indicates =org-tags-view=. Thus, the query uses
the tags/property search syntax.

Mr. Gnu realizes he can save an even faster version of the search
above:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
               '("B" "Big books (fast)" search "{:BIB_PAGES:\\s-+[0-9]\\{4\\}}"))
#+end_src

The symbol "search", as you might have guessed, instructs Org-mode to
use =org-search-view=. And the saved search finds all items with
=BIB_PAGES= property that contain four digits (i.e., > 1000 pages).

You might notice that the search query here, compared with the one
above, contains extra backslashes. That is because the backslash is a
special character in emacs-lisp and thus needs to be escaped when
placed in an =.emacs= file.

If Mr. Gnu frequently need to perform the "urgent wedding tasks"
search above, he could add a command such as the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
               '("w" "Getting married next week!" 
                 search "!+wedding +{:\\(urgent\\|important\\):}"))
#+end_src

Finally, one can use custom commands to run searches with different
local settings. For instance, one can set up a custom agenda command
to run a tags/property search on files other than the agenda files:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
               '("r" "Reference material" tags ""
                 ((org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/ref/*.org")))))
#+end_src

For a full introduction to custom agenda commands, please see [[file:org-custom-agenda-commands.org][this
tutorial]].
