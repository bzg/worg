* Introduction

  You should be comfortable with publishing Org-mode fiels to HTML already when
  you read this. Make sure, to create the tree-style sitemap-file on export.

  This Tutorial describes a simple technique to include published content into
  other web applications. I use an external JavaScript treemenu library publish
  by Marco Pratesi. This treemenu is fast and runs in all Browsers I'm aware
  of. The techniqe could as well be adopted to other menu libs.

  You might as well use the Menu as kind of sitemap or top menu.

  - The homepage of Phplaymenu is here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplayersmenu/
  - A demo can be found on http://phplayersmenu.sourceforge.net/demo.php

  Here is a screenshot of a treemenu:

  {{{BeginInfoBox}}} *Note:* Prior to Org-mode commit
  [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/commit/4892c8899e5b99d041836749fb2d1458971be55d][4892c8899e5b99d041836749fb2d1458971be55d]] (version 6.34trans), =sitemap-file=
  =auto-sitemap= a.s.o. where called =index-file=, =auto-index= and similar. I you
  have to work with a version released before 25th of February 2010, just
  replace =sitemap= with =index= throughout this file.

* How the menus work

  The menus are read from a string of a special structure. While it is beyond
  this tutorial to explain the usage of the menus in details, the structure of
  this string is important.

  Each line of the string consists of these elements:

  : [dots]|[text]|[link]|[title]|[icon]|[target]|[expanded]

  Everything in brackets is optional. So are any trailing bars, if empty.

  The tree structure is represented by prepended dots.

  Example:

  : .|Top level directory without link
  : ..|Article 1|articles/article1.html|||main
  : ..|Article 2|articles/article2.html|||main
  : .|Snippets
  : ..|C++|snippets/c++.html|||main
  : ..|Perl|snippets/Perl.html|||main

  will result in either in a tree menu like this here (=[F]= is an optional
  folder icon:

  : - [F] Top level directory without link
  :    |
  :    +-- Article 1
  :    `-- Article 2
  :
  : - [F] Snippets
  :    |
  :    +-- C++
  :    `-- Perl

  ...or a menubar like this:

  : .__________________________________.__________.
  : | Top level directory without link | Snippets |
  : `----------------------------------|          |
  :                                    | C++      |
  :                                    | Perl     |
  :                                    `----------'

* Creating the menu structure when publishing

  To create the menu structure, I use a modified version of the elisp function
  =org-publish-org-sitemap=, defined in =Org-mode/lisp/org-publish.el=, that generates
  the sitemap for HTML export. The function is called
  =sr-org-notes-sitemap-complete= and defined in one of my emacs setup files.

  Fortunately, Org-mode makes it possible to call a function after the
  publishing process has fineshed. To make use of =sr-org-notes-sitemap-complete=,
  add this to your publishing project's definition:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("org-notes"
         :base-directory "~/org/notes/"

         ;; ...

         ;; Important:
         :auto-sitemap t ; generate sitemap.org automagically
         :sitemap-filename "sitemap.org" ; this is the default
         :sitemap-style "tree"

         ;; Layersmenu:
         :completion-function sr-org-notes-sitemap-complete
         :menu/structure-file "~/path/to/menu-structure-file.txt"
         :menu/link-target "mitte" ;; optional

         ;; ...

         )))
#+end_src

  Once you re-publish your project, the menu-structure file will be created.

* =my-org-notes-sitemap-complete=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sr-org-notes-sitemap-complete ()
  "Take the sitemap-file and turn it into the menu-structure
file for Marco Pratesi's phplayersmenu."
  (let* ((base-dir (file-name-as-directory (plist-get project-plist :base-directory)))
         (orig (expand-file-name (concat base-dir (plist-get project-plist :sitemap-filename))))
         (strip-suffix (or (plist-get project-plist :base-extension) "org"))
         (add-suffix (or (plist-get project-plist :html-extension) "html"))
         (link-target (or (plist-get project-plist :menu/link-target) "_blank"))
         (menu-file (or (plist-get project-plist :menu/structure-file) nil))

         (visiting-output (find-buffer-visiting menu-file))

         (input-buffer (find-file orig))
         (output-buffer (find-file menu-file))

         (old-ndots 1)
         (sub "")
         (old-sub ""))

    (unless menu-file
      (throw 'sr-org-note-kb-completion-error
             "No menu structure file provided. Giving up."))

    (with-current-buffer output-buffer
      (erase-buffer))

    (with-current-buffer input-buffer
      (widen)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward org-bracket-link-analytic-regexp (point-max) t)
        (let ((link (match-string-no-properties 3))
              (text (match-string-no-properties 5))
              (pos 0)
              (ndots 1))

      (with-current-buffer output-buffer
        (if (string-match (concat "\\(" strip-suffix "\\)$") link)
            (setq link (replace-match add-suffix t t link)))
        (while (setq pos (string-match "/" link pos))
          (setq ndots (+ ndots 1))
          (setq pos (+ pos 1)))

        (when (< 1 ndots)
          (string-match "\\(/[^/]*\\)$" link)
          (setq sub (replace-match "" t t link))

          (unless (string= sub old-sub)
            (let ((ds 0)
                  (subs (split-string sub "/"))
                  (old-subs (split-string old-sub "/")))
              (while (string= (car old-subs) (car subs))
                (setq ds (+ ds 1))
                (pop old-subs)

                (insert
                 (concat
                  (make-string ds ?.) "|" d "\n")))
              (setq old-sub sub))))

        (insert
         (concat
          (make-string ndots ?.) "|" text "|" link "|||" link-target "\n"))
        (setq old-ndots ndots)
        ))))

    (or visiting (kill-buffer input-buffer))

    (with-current-buffer output-buffer

))
#+end_src

* Include the menu in existing pages

  To actually use the result, download the Phplayersmenu library and unpack
  it. Move the following subfolders to your webroot:

  * =phplayersmenu-3.2.0/lib/=
  * =phplayersmenu-3.2.0/libjs/=
  * =phplayersmenu-3.2.0/menuimages/=

  Also choose one of the stylesheets in =phplayersmenu-3.2.0/=. In the example
  below, the =layerstreemenu.css= is used.

  Adjust the file(s) you want to include the menu in. Here is an example:

#+begin_src html -n -r
 <html>
  <head>
   <script type="text/javascript">
    <?php include ("libjs/layersmenu-browser_detection.js"); ?>
   </script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="layerstreemenu.css" type="text/css"></link> (ref:tree1)
   <script type="text/javascript" src="libjs/layerstreemenu-cookies.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    ...

    <div>
 <?php
    include ("lib/PHPLIB.php");   // taken from PHPLib
    include ("lib/layersmenu-common.inc.php");
    include ("lib/treemenu.inc.php");          (ref:tree2)
    if ( @ is_file ("../intranet/navigations/org.txt") )
    {
      $mid = new TreeMenu();  (ref:tree3)
      $mid->setMenuStructureFile("navigations/org.txt");
      $mid->setPrependedUrl("../org-notes/");   (ref:url1)
      $mid->parseStructureForMenu("treemenu1");
      print $mid->newTreeMenu("treemenu1"); (ref:tree4)
    }
 ?>
    </div>
  </body>
 </html>
#+end_src

  What makes your menu a tree-menu, are

  * the stylesheet ([[(tree1)][line (tree1)]]),
  * theinclusion of treemenu.inc.php ([[(tree2)][in line (tree2)]]),
  * the constructor used ([[(tree3)][line (tree3)]]),
  * and the =newTreeMenu()= method ([[(tree4)][called in line (tree4)]]).

  The (optional) [[(url1)][URL provided in line (url1)]] is prepended to all the URLs found
  in the menu-structure file.

  See the Phplayersmenu docs on how to create horizontal and vertical menus from
  the same structure file.
