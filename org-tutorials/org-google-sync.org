* Overview
  To get a real synchronization between org-mode and Google Calendar
  you need to sync two ways. We cover one way of handling the
  synchronization in the next two sections and also mention some other
  ways of synchronization at the end.
* From Google Calendar into org using .ics files
  Google Calendar offers access to each calendar via a hidden/secret
  url. That is, a url that only you know about and is very hard to
  guess for other people. You can use this to download your calendar
  in an iCalendar (.ics) format, which we then can rewrite into
  something usable for org-mode. For this conversion there luckily
  already exists a script written by Eric S. Fraga[fn:1].

  You can get the latest version here: [[https://github.com/msherry/ical2org/blob/master/ical2org.awk][ical2org.awk]]

With this you can test your Google Calendar to org-mode
synchronization by following these steps:

1. Download the above script and save it as 'ical2org'.
   Make sure that the script is in your PATH and don't forget to set
   the executable flag (~chmod u+x ical2org~). You should customize the
   script by changing the variables in the config section of the script.
   Note in particular 'max_age' for setting which entries are converted,
   and 'author' and 'email_address' for setting your details.
2. Find your private URL for your calendar
  + Log into Google Calendar
  + Goto Settings
  + Click on the calendar you want to export to org-mode
  + At the bottom of the page find the 'private address' section and your ical link
    Use the 'reset private urls' if you need to, that is if you don't
    see a unique url.
3. Download the url
   This can be done for example using 'wget <url>'
4. Transform into org-file
   Use the downloaded script via 'ical2org < icsfile > orgfile'. Where
   icsfile is the path to the file you downloaded from Google and
   orgfile is the org-mode file you want to create.
5. Add the orgfile to your agenda and test

If this all works you can automate the task via cron. Create a script
such as the following that will automatically download and convert
your calendar. Make sure that this file is only readable by you (chmod
700 <file>), since it will contain the url to your Google calendar.

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/bash

# customize these
WGET=<path to wget>
ICS2ORG=<path to ical2org>
ICSFILE=<path for icsfile>
ORGFILE=<path to orgfile>
URL=<url to your private Google calendar>

# no customization needed below

$WGET -O $ICSFILE $URL
$ICS2ORG < $ICSFILE > $ORGFILE
#+end_src

automate this via cron by adding something like the following to your
crontab:

#+begin_example
5,20,35,50 * * * * <path to above script> &> /dev/null #sync my org files
#+end_example

This will sync every 15 minutes starting at 5 minutes past the hour.

* From org to Google Calendar

  You can export from org mode to .ics; upload .ics to a public web
  server giving it a hidden/secret name; tell Google to import this
  .ics file.

  This has the disadvantage that the item won't show up in your "main"
  calendar and therefore you can't easily share them with
  others. Nevertheless, this route is relatively easy and therefore
  we'll discuss it below.

  Also keep in mind that your mileage will vary, since everything
  described on this page works for some people, but perhaps not for
  you... if this is the case, feel free to ask on the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-mailing-list.html][org mailing list]]
  and perhaps we can add missing features.

  Back to the topic. We need org to export an .ics file, which can be
  achieved using the function:
  ~org-export-icalendar-combine-agenda-files~.
  This will export all entries in you agenda. If you only want to
  export certain ones, you can set up a filter. For this we will
  define a filter function and then tell Emacs to use this filter.
  The filter shown here, will exclude items with a category "google"
  (for example from the =ical2org= script) and "private" and also only
  export entries that have a date and a time range set (that is, a
  start and a end time stamp). You can modify the function though to
  do anything you want!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;;; define categories that should be excluded
  (setq org-export-exclude-category (list "google" "private"))

  ;;; define filter. The filter is called on each entry in the agenda.
  ;;; It defines a regexp to search for two timestamps, gets the start
  ;;; and end point of the entry and does a regexp search. It also
  ;;; checks if the category of the entry is in an exclude list and
  ;;; returns either t or nil to skip or include the entry.

  (defun org-mycal-export-limit ()
    "Limit the export to items that have a date, time and a range. Also exclude certain categories."
    (setq org-tst-regexp "<\\([0-9]\\{4\\}-[0-9]\\{2\\}-[0-9]\\{2\\} ... [0-9]\\{2\\}:[0-9]\\{2\\}[^\r\n>]*?\
  \)>")
    (setq org-tstr-regexp (concat org-tst-regexp "--?-?" org-tst-regexp))
    (save-excursion
      ; get categories
      (setq mycategory (org-get-category))
      ; get start and end of tree
      (org-back-to-heading t)
      (setq mystart    (point))
      (org-end-of-subtree)
      (setq myend      (point))
      (goto-char mystart)
      ; search for timerange
      (setq myresult (re-search-forward org-tstr-regexp myend t))
      ; search for categories to exclude
      (setq mycatp (member mycategory org-export-exclude-category))
      ; return t if ok, nil when not ok
      (if (and myresult (not mycatp)) t nil)))

  ;;; activate filter and call export function
  (defun org-mycal-export ()
    (let ((org-icalendar-verify-function 'org-mycal-export-limit))
      (org-export-icalendar-combine-agenda-files)))
#+end_src

  To use these function you can include the above code in your .emacs
  file and then in case you run Emacs server call

#+begin_src sh
  emacsclient -e "(save-excursion (org-mycal-export))"
#+end_src

  in your shell to generate the .ics file.

  If you want to export also TODO items that have a SCHEDULED timestamp, you can set

#+begin_src sh
  (setq org-icalendar-use-scheduled '(todo-start event-if-todo))
#+end_src

  in your .emacs.

  Another Emacs variable that you might want to look into is:
  ~org-icalendar-honor-noexport-tag~.

  You can now automate this via a cron job to generate updated .ics
  files.

  The next step is to give the file a cryptic name (so that other
  people have a hard time accessing your file, also make sure that
  your web server doesn't show an index for your directory, etc.) and
  copy it to a public accessible web server. Then log into your Google
  calendar and in the left column under "Other calendars" use
  "Add"->"Add by url" to point Google at your freshly generated .ics
  file and you should be all set up. Once you done this Google will
  every now and then (every few hours?) look for a newer version of your .ics file and
  include this in your calendar.

* Other methods of syncing

** org-caldav

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I have written a package 'org-caldav' which can sync items to a remote
calendar server using the CalDAV protocol. The main purpose of this
package is to make better use of Org in combination with Android-based
mobile devices (yes, there is mobileOrg, but I have several problems
with it; that's a topic for another day, though).

I think org-caldav is now "good enough" to allow some testing by
adventurous people. I put the code up on github here

https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav
#+END_QUOTE

** org-gcal

org-gcal allows bi-directional syncing between org and Google Calendar.
The code and documentation is available on GitHub:
