* Introduction

This tutorial summarizes one specific method which defines (process)
elements within tables in order to generate a simple work flow
diagram using [[https://code.google.com/p/pydot/][dot]].

An alternative way of accomplishing the task would be using [[http://plantuml.com/][PlantUML]]
(a wrapper to [[http://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz]]) which can be [[http://plantuml.com/emacs][integrated to Emacs]] as well.

We first demonstrate a compact version for one-time usage (tables and
code snippet). Then, we show how to re-use this method for multiple
sets of tables in an efficient way.

* Defining the Process Elements

We are using tables to define our work-flow. The first table holds
the node identifiers (internal names), node labels, optional shape
definitions, and optional fill colors:

: #+name: example-node-table
: | *node*     | *label*        | *shape* | *fillcolor* |
: |------------+----------------+---------+-------------|
: | S_start    | start          | ellipse | green       |
: | S_fill     | fill form      |         |             |
: | S_send     | send form      |         |             |
: | S_complete | form complete? | diamond | yellow      |
: | S_do       | do task        |         | red         |
: | S_end      | end            | ellipse |             |

The second table contains information about connections between nodes
(using node identifiers) and optional labels:

: #+name: example-graph
: | from       | to         | label |
: |------------+------------+-------|
: | S_start    | S_fill     |       |
: | S_fill     | S_send     |       |
: | S_send     | S_complete |       |
: | S_complete | S_fill     | N     |
: | S_complete | S_do       | Y     |
: | S_do       | S_end      |       |

* ELISP code snippet for generating the diagram using dot

In the next step, we are going to generate the diagram file (in PNG
format) using [[https://code.google.com/p/pydot/][dot]]. You should make sure that you have a working dot
installation and probably tried out [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-dot.html][a tutorial about using dot within
Org-mode]].

The author of this code is [[https://orgmode.org/list/4c174089656ce0b08177f464325c4bf9@mail.rickster.com][Rick Frankel]]. It is written in Emacs LISP
which directly executes the generated dot script:

: #+name: graph-from-tables
: #+HEADER: :var nodes=example-node-table graph=example-graph
: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :file ~/example-diagram.png :colnames yes :exports results
:     (org-babel-execute:dot
:      (concat
:           "digraph {\n"
:           "//rankdir=LR;\n" ;; remove comment characters '//' for horizontal layout; add for vertical layout
:           (mapconcat
:            (lambda (x)
:              (format "%s [label=\"%s\" shape=%s style=\"filled\" fillcolor=\"%s\"]"
:                              (car x)
:                              (nth 1 x)
:                              (if (string= "" (nth 2 x)) "box" (nth 2 x))
:                              (if (string= "" (nth 3 x)) "none" (nth 3 x))
:                              )) nodes "\n")
:           "\n"
:           (mapconcat
:            (lambda (x)
:              (format "%s -> %s [taillabel=\"%s\"]"
:                              (car x) (nth 1 x) (nth 2 x))) graph "\n")
:           "}\n") params)
: #+END_SRC

As you can see, the node table and the graph table are being defined
in the header using the ~:var~ argument for babel. The resulting PNG
file name is defined as ~:file~ argument below.

By executing the babel script (e.g., ~C-c C-c~) the PNG file gets
created.

You can remove the dot-comment (~//~) in front of ~rankdir~ in order
to switch to a horizontal layout of the diagram.

* Re-using the code snippet with call-statements

When you are generating multiple diagrams within one single Org-mode
file, you might want to re-use the ELISP code for all of your
diagrams. However, you want to use different definition tables and a
different output file name. The ELISP code is the same for all of
them.

This can be achieved by using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-code-blocks.html][the ~call~ command]]. In this example, we
are re-using the ELISP code from above with two newly created tables
of the very important process 42 (please notice also the differences
in the ~name~ arguments of the tables):

: #+name: process42-node-table
: | *node*  | *label*             | *shape* | *fillcolor* |
: |---------+---------------------+---------+-------------|
: | mystart | start               | ellipse | yellow      |
: | mywatch | is Bob here?        | diamond |             |
: | mywait  | wait for 10 minutes |         | red         |
: | mytalk  | talk to Bob         |         |             |
: | myend   | end                 | ellipse | green       |

The second table contains information about connections between nodes
(using node identifiers) and optional labels:

: #+name: process42-graph
: | from    | to      | label |
: |---------+---------+-------|
: | mystart | mywatch |       |
: | mywatch | mywait  | N     |
: | mywait  | mywatch |       |
: | mywatch | mytalk  | Y     |
: | mytalk  | myend   |       |

The ~call~ statement consists of the name of the code
(~graph-from-tables~), an insider header argument for the new file
name, and arguments which defines the input tables. For [[https://orgmode.org/list/5e6cbdf1d1de558009527836766630b7@mail.rickster.com][technical
reasons]], we have to add table ranges as well (~[2:-1]~):

: #+call: graph-from-tables[:file ~/diagram-process42.png](nodes=process42-node-table[2:-1],graph=process42-graph[2:-1]) :results file

By invoking the call statement (place the cursor on it and use the
usual ~C-c C-c~ command to execute), you generate the diagram for our
process 42:

That's it.

Pretty handy for generating (simple) process diagrams.
