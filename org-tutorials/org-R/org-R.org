* Important
  Org-R has been replaced by [[file:../../org-contrib/babel/index.org][Org-babel]] which provides a much improved
  environment for executing code in many languages (including R) in
  Org documents. The off-the-shelf plotting functions of Org-R have
  not yet been transferred to org-babel (i.e. you'd have to construct
  the R code yourself). If you have requests for any plotting or other
  analysis features that you would like to see added to Org-babel,
  please send them to the Org mailing list. Fragments of code (in
  whatever language) which allow specific tasks such as data plotting
  to be accomplished in Org-mode will be maintained in the [[file:/usr/local/src/Worg/org-contrib/babel/library-of-babel.org][Library of
  Babel]].

  Org-R has now been removed from the contrib directory of the org
  distribution, but is still available (but not maintained) [[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~davison/software/org-R/org-R.el][here]].

* Introduction
  org-R is an org-mode extension that performs numerical computations
  and generates graphics. Numerical output may be stored in the org
  buffer in org tables, and the input can also come from an org
  table. Rather than starting off by documenting everything
  systematically, I'll provide several commented examples. Towards the
  end there are lists of [[*Table of available actions][available actions]] and [[*Table of available options][other options]].
  
  Although, behind the scenes, it uses [[http://www.r-project.org][R]], you do not need to know
  anything about R. Common operations are provided `off the shelf' by
  specifying options on lines starting with #+R:. Having said that,
  org-R also accepts raw R code (#+RR: lines). For those who don't
  yet know R, but think they might be interested, try the showcode:t
  option. It displays the R code corresponding to the action you
  requested, and so provides a good starting point for fine-tuning
  your analysis. But that's getting ahead of things.

  My hope is, of course, that this will be of use to people. So at
  this stage any comments, ideas, feedback, bug reports etc would be
  very welcome. I'd be happy to help anyone that's interested in
  using this, via the Org mailing list.

  If you'd like to try out these commands yourself, the Org file that
  created this web page is @<a href="org-R.org">here@</a>.

* Setting things up
  The code is currently [[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~davison/software/org-R/org-R.el][here]] Soon it will be in the contrib
  directory. The other things you need are R (Windows / OS X binaries
  available on the [[http://www.r-project.org][R website]] widely available in linux package
  repositories) and the emacs mode [[http://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs Speaks Statistics]] (ESS). ESS
  installation instructions are [[http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#Installation][here.]]  Personally, under linux, I have
  something like

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ess/lisp")
(require 'ess-site)
#+END_SRC

* Using org-R
  org-R uses two different option lines to specify an analysis/plot:
  #+R: and #+RR:. #+RR: is the one that accepts R code, so we'll
  ignore that for now. To make the action happen, issue C-c C-c with
  point in the #+R: line (this calls org-R-apply). There are also
  org-R-apply-in-subtree and org-R-apply-in-buffer, which visit each
  org-R block that they find in the current subtree/buffer, calling
  org-R-apply in that block (suggestion from Tom Short). So, first
  example.

* Computing on org tables: tabulating values
   Here's a command to tabulate the values in the second column. Issue
   M-x org-R-apply in the following #+R line.

#+begin_example

| col1 | col2 |
|------+------|
| A    | A    |
| A    | B    |
| B    | B    |
#+R: action:tabulate columns:2

#+end_example

  That results in

#+begin_example

| value | count |
|-------+-------|
| A     |     1 |
| B     |     2 |

#+end_example

  . So the values in column 2 were tabulated as requested. However,
  the original data got overwritten. That leads us to

* Table references
   
   We can specify input data for analysis/plotting in 3 different
   ways:
   
   1. by providing a reference to an org table with the intable:
      option. You can optionally specify the org file that the table
      is in with infile:/path/to/file.org

   2. by pointing it to a csv file, locally or via http:, using
     infile:/path/to/file.csv or e.g.
     infile:http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~davison/software/org-R/file.csv

   3. by doing neither, in which case it looks for a table immediately
     above the #+R(R) line(s).

Case (3) is what happened above -- the input data came from a table
immediately above the #+R line. The default behaviour is to replace
any such table with the output; this allows us to tweak the option
line and update the analysis. However, normally we'll want to separate
the data from the analysis output. So let's keep the data as a named
table in the org file, and refer to it by name:

#+begin_example

#+TBLNAME:data-set-1
| col1 | col2 |
|------+------|
| A    | A    |
| A    | B    |
| B    | B    |

[arbitrary other content of org buffer]

#+R: intable:data-set-1 action:tabulate

#+end_example

which results in

#+begin_example

|   | A | B |
|---+---+---|
| A | 1 | 1 |
| B | 0 | 1 |

#+end_example

Note that this time we did a different analysis: I removed the
columns:2 option, so that tabulate was passed the whole table. As a
result the output contains counts of joint occurrences of values in
the two columns: out of the 4 possibilities, the only one we didn't
observe was "B in column 1 and A in column 2". We could have achieved
the same result with columns:(1 2). (But don't try to tabulate more
than 2 columns: org does not do multi-dimensional tables).

* Plotting data
** Available off-the-shelf plotting commands
  At the risk of this starting to sound like a dodgy undergraduate
  statistics textbook, the sort of plots that are appropriate depend
  on the sort of data. Let's divide it up as

 - discrete-valued data
    [e.g. data-set-1 above, or the list of org variables customised by users]
 - continuous-valued data
   [e.g. the wing lengths of all Eagle Owls in Europe]
 - indexed data 
   [e.g. a data set in which each point is a time,
    together with the size of the org source code base at that time]

The available off-the-shelf actions are listed [[*Table of available actions][here]].

** Continuous data example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       2ce0fc04-b308-4b8d-8acc-805a9e5fed7d
    :END:
    We're going to need some data. So let's prove that org can also
    speak statistics and use org-R to simulate the data. This
    requires some raw R code, so skip this bit if you're not
    interested.

    The following #+RR line simulates 10 values from a Normal
    distribution with mean -3, and 10 values from a Normal
    distribution with mean 3, and lumps them together. The point is that
    the numbers we get should be concentrated around two different
    values, and we should be able to see that in a histogram and/or
    density plot.

#+begin_example

#+RR: x <- c(rnorm(10, mean=-3, sd=1), rnorm(10, mean=3, sd=1))
#+R: title:"continuous-data" output-to-buffer:t

#+end_example

Here's what I got.  Note that the title: option set the name of the
table with "#+TBLNAME"; we'll use that to refer to these data.

#+begin_example

#+TBLNAME:continuous-data
|            values |
|-------------------|
| -2.48627002467785 |

#+end_example    

Now to plot the data. Let's have some colour as well, and this time
the title: option will be used to put a title on the plot (and also to
name the file link to the graphical output).


#+begin_example

[[file:tmp.png][histogram example]]
#+R: action:hist columns:1 colour:hotpink 
#+R: intable:continuous-data outfile:"png" title:"histogram example"

#+end_example
[[file:../../images/org-R/histogram-example.png]]

[Note that you can use multiple #+R lines rather than cramming all
the options on to one line.]

An alternative would be to produce a density plot. We don't have
enough data points to justify that here, but we'll do it anyway just
to show the sort of plots that are produced. This time we'll specify
the output file for the png image using the output: option. (For the
histogram we used output:"png". That's a special case; it doesn't
create a file called "png" but instead uses org-attach to store the
output in the org-attach dir for this entry. Same thing for the other
available output image formats: "jpg", "jpeg", "pdf", "ps", "bmp",
"tiff")

#+begin_example

[[file:density.png][density plot example]]
#+R: action:density columns:"values" colour:chartreuse4 args:(:lwd 4)
#+R: intable:continuous-data outfile:"density.png" title:"density plot example"

#+end_example
[[file:../../images/org-R/density.png]]

There were a couple of new features there. Firstly, I referred to
column 1 using its column label, rather than with the
integer 1. Secondly, note the use of the args: option. It takes the
form of a lisp property list ("p-list"), specifying extra arguments to
pass to the R function (in this case density()). Here we used it to
set the line thickness (lwd=4).

** Discrete data example: the configuration variables survey

The raw data, as collected by Manish, are in a table called
org-variables-table, in a file called variable-popcon.org. We use the
file: option to specify the org file containing the data, and the
table: option to specify the name of the table within that file. [An
alternative be to give the entry containing the table a unique id with
org-id-get-create, refer to it with table:<uid>, and rely on the
org-id mechanism to find it.].

Now we tabulate the data. (We're not currently taking the sensible
step that Manish did of checking whether the variables were given
values different from their default).

 Rather than cluttering up this org file with all the count data,
we'll store them in a separate org file:

#+begin_example

[[file:org-variables-counts.org][org-variables-counts]]
#+R: action:tabulate columns:2 sort:t
#+R: infile:"variable-popcon.org" intable:"org-variables-table"
#+R: outfile:"org-variables-counts.org" title:"org-variables-counts"

#+end_example
[[file:org-variables-counts.org]]

We can see the top few rows of the table by using action:head

#+begin_example

| rownames(x) | value                       | count |
|-------------+-----------------------------+-------|
|           1 | org-agenda-files            |    22 |
|           2 | org-agenda-start-on-weekday |    22 |
|           3 | org-log-done                |    22 |
|           4 | org-todo-keywords           |    22 |
|           5 | org-agenda-include-diary    |    19 |
|           6 | org-hide-leading-stars      |    19 |
#+R: action:head
#+R: infile:"org-variables-counts.org" intable:"org-variables-counts" output-to-buffer:t

#+end_example

Here's a barplot of the counts. It makes it clear that over half the
org variables are customised by only one or two users.

#+begin_example

[[file:org-variables-barplot.png][org-variables barplot]]
#+R: action:barplot rownames:t columns:1 width:800 col:darkblue
#+R: args:(:names.arg "NULL")
#+R: infile:"org-variables-counts.org" intable:"org-variables-counts"
#+R: outfile:"org-variables-barplot.png" title:"org-variables barplot"

#+end_example
[[file:../../images/org-R/org-variables-barplot.png]]

*** Something more complicated: clustering org variables, and org users

     OK, let's make a bit more use of R's capabilities. We can use the
     org-variables data set to define distances between pairs of org
     users (how similar their customisations are), and distances
     between pairs of org variables (the extent to which people who
     customise one of them customise the other). Then we can use those
     distance matrices to cluster org users, and org variables.

     First, let's create a table that's restricted to variables that
     were customised by more than four users. This isn't necessary,
     but there are a lot of org-variables! This is going to require a
     bit of R code to count the variables and then subset the raw data
     accordingly:

#+begin_example

[[file:variable-popcon-restricted.org][org-variables-table]]
#+R: infile:"variable-popcon.org" intable:"org-variables-table"
#+R: outfile:"variable-popcon-restricted.org" title:"org-variables-table"
#+RR: tab <- table(x[,2])
#+RR: x <- subset(x, Variable %in% names(tab[tab > 4]))

#+end_example
[[file:variable-popcon-restricted.org][org-variables-table]]

Now let's make a table with a row for each variable, and a column for
each org user, and fill it with 1s and 0s according to whether user j
customised variable i. We can do that without writing any R code:

#+begin_example

[[file:org-variables-incidence.org][incidence-matrix]]
#+R: action:tabulate columns:(1 2) rownames:t
#+R: infile:"variable-popcon-restricted.org" intable:"org-variables-table"
#+R: outfile:"org-variables-incidence.org" title:"incidence-matrix"

#+end_example
[[file:org-variables-incidence.org][incidence-matrix]]

First we'll cluster org users. We use the R function dist to compute a
distance matrix from the incidence matrix, then hclust to run a
hierarchical clustering algorithm, and then plot to plot the results
as a dendrogram:

#+begin_example

[[file:org-users-tree.png][org-users-tree.png]]
#+RR: par(bg="gray15", fg="turquoise2")
#+RR: plot(hclust(dist(x, method="binary")), ann=FALSE)
#+R: infile:"org-variables-incidence.org" intable:"incidence-matrix" rownames:t
#+R: outfile:"org-users-tree.png" title:"org-users-tree.png"

#+end_example
[[file:../../images/org-R/org-users-tree.png]]

And to cluster org variables, we use the transpose of that incidence matrix:

#+begin_example

[[file:org-variables-tree.png][org-variables-tree.png]]
#+RR: par(bg="gray15", fg="turquoise2")
#+RR: plot(hclust(dist(t(x), method="binary")), ann=FALSE)
#+R: infile:"org-variables-incidence.org" intable:"incidence-matrix" rownames:t
#+R: outfile:"org-variables-tree.png" title:"org-variables-tree.png" width:1000

#+end_example
[[file:../../images/org-R/org-variables-tree.png]]


Please note that my main aim here was to give some examples of using
org-R, rather than to show how the org variables data should be mined
for useful information! The org-variables dendrogram does seem to have
made some sensible clusterings (e.g. the clusters of agenda-related
commands), but I'm going to leave it to others to decide whether this
exercise really served to do more than illustrate org-R. Does anyone
recognise any usage affinities between the clustered org users?

Apart from tabulate, the action: names are the same as the names of
the R functions which implement them. `tabulate' is really called
`table' in R.

  Note that, in addition to the actions listed below, you can also use
action:R-function, where "R-function" is the name of any existing R
function. The function must be able to take a data frame as its first
argument, and must not *require* any further arguments (i.e. any
further arguyments must have suitable default values). Any numerical
output will be sent to the org buffer (use output-to-buffer:t to force
this, although if that is necessary then that is a bug).

* More detailed description of org-R
  My aim with org-R is to provide a fairly general facility for using
   R with Org. The #+R lines and #+RR lines together specify an R
   function, which may take numerical input, and may generate
   graphical output, or numerical output, or both.

If any input data have been specified, then the R function receives
   those data as its first argument. The input data may come from an
   Org table, or from a csv spreadsheet file. In either case they are
   tabular (1- or 2-dimensional). The input data are passed to the
   function as an R data frame (a table-like structure in which
   different columns may contain different types of data -- numeric,
   character, etc). Inside the R function, that data frame is called
   'x'. 'x' is also the return value of the R function. Therefore the
   numerical output of org-R is determined by the modifications to the
   variable x that are made inside the function (any graphical output
   is a side effect.)

It's worth noting that one mode of using org-R would be to write your
own code in a separate file, and use the source() function on a #+RR
line to evaluate the code in that file.

Numerical output of the function should also be tabular, and may be
   received by the Org buffer as an Org table, or sent to file in Org
   table or csv format. R deals transparently with multi-dimensional
   arrays, but Org table and csv format do not.

Unless an output file has been specified, graphical output will be
displayed on screen.

* Getting help with R
  - Bring up an R prompt with R at a shell prompt, or M-x R in emacs (if you have installed ESS)
  - Enter ?function.name for help on function `function.name'
  - Enter RSiteSearch("words") for online help matching "words"
  - Enter ?par to see the full list of graphical parameters
  - Follow the Documentation link on the left hand side of the R
    website for "An Introduction to R", and other more technical manuals.
* Brief advert for R
  Seeing as this has made use of R, I'll briefly say my bit on it for
  those who are unfamiliar.
  1. It's good for simple numerical work, as well as having
     implementations of a a very large range of more sophisticated
     mathematical and statistical procedures.
  2. It's good for producing graphics quickly, and for fine tuning
     every last detail of the graphics for publication.
  3. It's a syntactically reasonable, user-friendly, interpreted
     programming language, that is often used interactively (it comes
     with its own shell/command-line environment, and runs within
     emacs using ESS).
  4. It's a good language for a functional style of programming (in
     fact I'd say that's how it should be used), which might well
     appeal to elisp programmers. For example, you want to construct
     an arbitrarily nested data structure, then pass some function
     over the tips, returning a data structure of the same shape as
     the input? No problem ([[http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/rapply.html][rapply]]).
  5. There's a *lot* of add-on packages for it (CRAN link on left hand
     side of [[http://www.r-project.org/][website]].).
  6. How many programming languages will get [[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html][their own article]] in the
     New York Times this year?
