* Introduction

#+INDEX: 8.0
#+INDEX: exporter
#+INDEX: migrating

The release of Org-mode 8.0 (and the git repository master branch, as of [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/commit/1cac3127c2f810e83fcc1203f1dd2b15250a687e][commit 1cac3127c]])
uses a new export framework, developed by Nicolas Goaziou. This document provides
information on general changes to Org, as well as the steps needed to update your
configuration properly.

If the instructions below do not help solving your problem, please ask any
question on the [[https://orgmode.org/community.html][mailing list]]. Keep in mind that the new export framework is under heavy
development, and posting to the mailing list will help not only to resolve your issues,
but also make sure that documentation is properly udpated for the benefit of others with
similar issues.

This page serves as an upgrade guide for the changes widely affecting users. /Please/
refer to the [[file:exporters/ox-overview.org][new exporter overview]], which contains an up to date list of
Org-mode exporters, and links to backend-specific setup and usage details.

* Files moved to =contrib/=

These files have been moved to the =contrib/= directory.

- =org-colview-xemacs.el=
- =org-mew.el=
- =org-wl.el=
- =org-w3m.el=
- =org-vm.el=
- =ox-taskjuggler.el= (was org-taskjuggler.el)
- =ox-freemind.el= (was org-freemind.el)

If you were using them, you need to [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html][add the =contrib/lisp= directory]]
of the Org distribution to the Emacs =load-path=.


* Original announcement of the new exporter

The most comprehensive overview of the new exporter may be found in Nicolas' merge
announcement [[https://orgmode.org/list/876229nrxf.fsf@gmail.com][in this email]] to the mailing list. Please scan the post, as you may find
answers to your questions there.

* Updating global export configuration options

Global export options start with the =org-export-*= prefix, most of them
are in the =ox.el= file.

Most generic export options should not require any changes. If
you find that a generic option is useless or broken or badly documented in
the manual, please report it to the list.

* Backend-specific configuration options

Backend-specific options are now defined via the convention =ox-backend-*=. For example:

- =org-html-*= for =HTML= and live in =ox-html.el=
- =org-latex-*= for =LaTeX= and live in =ox-latex.el=
- Etc.

There is a new variable =org-export-backends= which controls what backends
are loaded when you lauch Org.  By default, the =ASCII=, =HTML= and =LaTeX=
are loaded; in contrast with the old exporter behavior, others will need to be explicitly
loaded in order to use them. See the [[Upgrading your setup][upgrade]] section for instructions.

** HTML-specific changes

Some html-specific options were renamed more signficantly or deleted. Examine this
table and update accordingly: 

| Org 7.9.3f (maint)                     | Master (8.0)                           |
|----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| org-export-html-style                  | org-html-head                          |
| org-export-html-style-extra            | org-html-head-extra                    |
| org-export-html-style-default          | org-html-head-include-default-style    |
| org-export-html-style-include-scripts  | org-html-head-include-scripts          |
| org-export-htmlized-org-css-url        | org-org-htmlized-css-url (in ox-org.el |
|----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| org-export-html-headline-anchor-format | Deleted                                |
| org-export-html-date-format-string     | Deleted                                |
| org-export-html-content-div            | Deleted                                |
| org-export-html-html-helper-timestamp  | Deleted                                |

** Org publishing specific changes
Some changes also specifically affect =org-publish-project-alist= settings. The publishing
functions are not loaded until the corresponding backend has been loaded.  You need to
update =org-publish-project-alist= and to use the function from the new publishing engine
in the table below: 

| Old publishing engine    | New publishing engine      |
|--------------------------+----------------------------|
| org-publish-org-to-html  | org-html-publish-to-html   |
| org-publish-org-to-org   | org-org-publish-to-org     |
| org-publish-org-to-latex | org-latex-publish-to-latex |
| ...                      | ...                        |


To specify a style for the project =:style= keyword changes to =:html-head=

If something does not work, please report it on the mailing list.



* Upgrading your setup

The practical implication for users upgrading from Org-mode < version 7.9.4f is two-fold:

- You must search your configuration for the existence of varaibles starting with
  =org-export-= and change their names (e.g. =org-export-html-validation-link= is now
  =org-html-validation-link=). /See sections below changes specific to the HTML and
  Publishing backends/. 

- If you use exporters in addition to =ASCII=, =HTML=, and/or =LaTeX=, you need to load them
  explicitly in your config via one of two ways (refer to  [[https://orgmode.org/list/876229nrxf.fsf@gmail.com][Nicolas' announcement]], section
  3 on Installation, for explanation of the two methods): 

*1: Load exporter upon first export execution per session*
#+begin_example
setq org-export-backends (quote (
       beamer
       md
       ...
       taskjuggler)))
#+end_example

*2: Loading all listed exporters upon Emacs startup*
#+begin_example
(require 'ox-beamer)
(require 'ox-md)
...
(require 'ox-taskjuggler)
#+end_example

*Note:* Please stick to /one/ of the above two methods!

** Using Org 7.9.3f or earlier versions of Org

For users who used the new exporter prior to its integration into the current master
branch, here are some additional steps you may need to do in order to upgrade properly:

1. Issue =make clean= before =git pull= and any changes to your
   configuration.

2. If you had already been using the new exporter from contrib, you should
   remove the following lines from your local.mk:
   : ORG_ADD_CONTRIB = org-e-*

3. Export engine renamed from =org-export= to =ox=

4. Backend requires renamed =org-e-*= to =ox-*=

5. All backend specific variables and functions renamed:
   - =org-export-*= to =org-*= (e.g. org-html-xml-declaration, ..)
   - =org-e-*= to =org-*= (e.g. org-latex-classes, org-ascii-bullets, ..)

6. Generic export variables retain the name =org-export-*=,
   (e.g. org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui,
   org-export-filter-headline-functions, ..)

7. =org-latex-to-pdf-process= renamed =org-latex-pdf-process=

8. This is a guess, export snippets and backend symbols renamed:
   - =e-<backend>= to =<backend>=

Again, please refer to [[http://mid.gmane.org/876229nrxf.fsf@gmail.com][Nicolas' announcement]] about the merge for more details.


* New global keywords
  
** New #+TOC keyword

In the exporting of a table of contents, options only allowed for setting the
level of the deepest table of contents headline, like so:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+OPTIONS: TOC:2
#+end_src

Upon export, only first and second level headlines would be included in the generated
table of contents. With the new exporter, a dedicated =#+TOC= now exists which allows for
futher customization: adding table of contents, lists of tables, and lists of listings at
specific locations during export. 

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+TOC: headlines 2
  ,#+TOC: tables
  ,#+TOC: listings
#+END_SRC

See the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Table-of-contents.html][Table of contents]] section in the manual for more information.

* Syntax changes

** Export snippets

   Export snippets are a generalization of ~@<tag>~ concept, which has
   been removed, and the inline version of ~#+begin_backend...#+end_backend~ blocks.

   Their syntax is ~@@backend:value~ where ~backend~ is the targetted
   export backend (e.g. ~html~) and ~value~ can contain anything but
   ~@@~.

   When export is done with ~backend~, the snippet is replaced with
   ~value~, otherwise it is removed.  Whitespace characters around
   the construct are never deleted.

** Footnote definitions

   A footnote definition (not inline) can now be ended with two
   consecutive blank lines.

   As a consequence, multiple paragraphs inside can be written
   normally, separated with blank lines, instead of relying on the
   ~\par~ command.

** Org-mode per-file options

- The =#+STYLE= option is now specified with =#+HTML_HEAD=

- Using =#+SETUPFILE: file= versus =#+INCLUDE: "file".=

   =#+INCLUDE:= keyword requires quotes around the file name. Those
  are optional in =#+SETUPFILE:=.

  There is now also a clear difference between these two statements.
  The first will only read keyword statements like =#+TODO:= and use
  this to set up the current file. The second will pull in the entire
  content of the file during export. The =#+INCLUDE:= statement will
  make every headline in the included file will be a child of the
  headline containing the include keyword. You can overwrite this
  behaviour with =:minlevel= num parameter.

- Attribute lines now take plists (similar to [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Babel code block syntax]]):

   : #+attr_latex: :width 5cm
   : #+attr_beamer: :options width=5cm
   : #+attr_html: :width 200px

  *TIP:* To upgrade from old =attr_html= lines with verbatim HTML
  attribute syntax, you could try a Perl one-liner like the following,
  replacing =filename.org= with your file (or a bunch of files with
  =*.org= if you're feeling adventurous -- no warranty, make sure
  you're backed up first!).
  
   : perl -i.bak -pe "s/([a-z]+)=(\"|')(.*?)\2/:\1 \3/g if /^#\+attr_html/i" filename.org

- Beamer backend now interprets nested headline levels as blocks instead
  of lists.  For more guidance, see [[file:exporters/beamer/ox-beamer.org][this page]].
