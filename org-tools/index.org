** Exporter for the Octopress blogging engine

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog
aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with
Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set
up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care
of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and
you’re set.
#+END_QUOTE

You can clone Octopress from [[https://github.com/imathis/octopress][the github repository]].

[[https://github.com/craftkiller/orgmode-octopress][orgmode-octopress]] is an exporter for Emacs Org-Mode to Octopress by
craftkiller.  For setup instructions, check [[http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/][this blog entry]].  Note that
orgmode-octopress will not work with the new export engine in Org 8.0.

** org2remind - perl script to convert org appointments to remind

 - Author: Matt Lundin
 - Code: [[file:../code/perl/org2remind.pl][org2remind]]

Remind is a command line calendar application for Unix/Linux that
can, among other things, spit out formatted plain text calendars and
agendas.

http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind

: To convert org-mode appointments to remind data, simply call the
: script on one or more org files:
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org
: 
: (Optionally, add the script to your path and make it executable.)
: 
: The results of this script can saved in a file...
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org >> org.rem 
: 
: ...or piped directly into a remind command...
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org | remind -
: 
: For a nice calendar of the current month, use the following: 
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org | remind -c -
: 
: This script is similar to org2rem.el (in the contrib directory of the
: org-mode repository), except that, instead of saving files from within
: org-mode, it allows for easier and faster access to org/remind data
: from the command line.
: 
: Currently, the script supports appointments (i.e., active timestamps)
: and the org-diary-class sexp.

** org-manage - locate and manage your org files
    - Author: Daniel German
    - Code:   [[http://github.com/dmgerman/org-manage][org-manage]] (based on [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]])
    - Lists all org files in a given directory and its subdirectories,
      providing a table of org files, including their title and category.

#+begin_quote
This is a module to help managing a large collection of org files. It
is based on org-octopress by Yoshinari Nomura.

org-manage scans a given directory (recursively) looking for org
files. For each, an entry is created. The title is extracted from the
attribute #+TITLE: in the org file. The category is extracted from the
first #+CATEGORY in the file (I suggest you add a default category to
each file.

    - Author: GitHub user cashTangoTangoCash
    - website: https://github.com/cashTangoTangoCash/orgFixLinks
    - repairs broken links in org files
    - currently Linux-only, but probably straighforward to port to Win/Mac?

#+begin_quote
 A stand-alone Python script designed to interactively repair broken
links to local files in one, many, or all of your org files.  OK, it's
an amateur command line script that likely needs more refinement, and
it chooses to do things that not everyone desires, but you can fork it
on GitHub, and adapt it to your own purposes.  If you are frustrated
by broken links to the degree that you are ready to debug a lengthy
Python script, why not play with it.  The GitHub wiki
https://github.com/cashTangoTangoCash/orgFixLinks/wiki provides a
degree of documentation.

- State of development: 2023-04-09 used by the author to convert his contacts for being imported to Android.

This workflow works great with one disadvantage: there is a [[https://github.com/novoid/org-contacts2vcard/issues/1][weird
issue where (random) contact images aren't imported]] since many Android
versions. Karl gave up analyzing it because he ran out of
ideas. However, for the contact information without images, it's
working flawlessly so far.

- State of development: 2023-04-09 used by the author on a daily basis; seems stable.

This small tool is very handy to be used, e.g., in shell scripts to
get error messages and so forth onto your Org-mode agenda.

** org-du - Visualizing Emacs Org-mode heading lines using [[https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/XDU][xdu]]

This fine trick is (mis-)using [[https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/XDU][xdu]] to get a graphical overview on the
structure of an [[https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/README.org][Orgdown]] file. See the screenshot in the README to get
an idea.

** postprocess_Org-mode_iCal_export - Post-processing iCal export files

- Bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/novoid/postprocess_Org-mode_iCal_export/issues
- State of development: 2023-04-09 not used by the author for a couple of years.

This tool post-processes iCal export results such taht you can hide
some data for privacy reasons or add reminder alarms defined as
Org-mode tags.

** orgmode-balance - feedback on how you are doing with your Org-mode tasks

This is a more or less quick hack that analyzes [[https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/README.org][Orgdown]] files and
gives feedback on how you are doing today (or at a given day).

The script lists:
- closed items,
- created items and
- items still due

The metrics are clearly subjective and should be improved. Please do
fork and send improvements via merge requests!

Example output:

:   Congratulations!  Not more tasks generated than solved!
