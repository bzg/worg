There is a strong desire to use Org-mode to manage both blogs and
wikis.  There are a number of tools which address parts of this need; this
page will serve as a collection of these tools' names, with links to their website and
brief descriptions.  I'm sure I've forgotten many relevant tools so *please
contribute*!

* Blogging tools

- [[https://renard.github.io/o-blog-v2/][o-blog]] :: [ *Unmaintained* ] Stand-alone blogging system that does not require any external
     software. ([[http://renard.github.com/o-blog/features.html][features]], [[https://github.com/renard/o-blog][Github source]]).

- [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] :: a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.  There are
     instructions for combining Org-mode with jekyll at [[file:org-tutorials/org-jekyll.org][Org-Jekyll]].

- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][Projects]] :: In most cases, using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][Org-mode publishing projects]] with
     its many options should be sufficient for publishing a blog.

- [[file:blorgit.org][Blorgit]] :: publish an interactive website based on Org-mode
     documents.  While blorgit has many nice features including the
     fact that Org-mode documents can be edited through the web
     interface with automatic commits to a git or svn repository, it is
     fairly complicated to set up.  Blorgit is one or two small changes
     from being a full-fledged Org-mode based wiki. This is no longer
     maintained, see [[org-ehtml][org-ehtml]] in the wiki section below.

- [[https://github.com/punchagan/blog-files][blog-files]] :: [ *Unmaintained* ] A simple system based on ideas and code from
     org-jekyll and reprise.py to publish a blog using simple static HTML pages.

- [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]] :: allows publishing directly from Org-mode to WordPress.

- [[http://jaderholm.com/blog/blogging-with-org-mode-and-octopress][Org-mode and Octopress]] :: Instructions for blogging with Org-mode
     and Octopress.  There is also this [[https://github.com/craftkiller/orgmode-octopress][dedicated exporter]] by Tom
     Alexander (instructions [[http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/][here]]). *NOTE*: The original article is down,
     there is an [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170801081337/http://jaderholm.com/blog/blogging-with-org-mode-and-octopress][archive in the Wayback Machine]].

- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Blorg][Blorg]] :: the original Org-mode blogging engine (but it's not
     maintained anymore).  Roland Kaufmann is maintaining a fork [[https://github.com/RolKau/blorg][here]].

- [[http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/45360][a blog-like sitemap for org-publish]] :: see [[http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/45360][this post]] by Jon Anders
     Skorpen.

- [[http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode][Org-mode and Nikola]] :: A plugin for [[http://getnikola.com][Nikola]] (a static site generator
     in Python) that lets you write your posts in Org-mode syntax.

- [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]] :: [ *Unmaintained* ] A static blog-site generator, written in Emacs Lisp. Very
     lightweight. Integrated with git. Supports theming. Uses
     [[http://mustache.github.io/][mustache]] for templating. Highly customizable. Key difference from
     o-blog is that org-page posts are in *separate* org-files. Built-in
     support for Disqus, Google Analytics and RSS.

- [[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg][lazyblorg]] :: a static blog-site generator written in Python (HTML5,
     CSS3). Focus is to have only an absolutely /minimum/ of things to
     do to write a new blog entry /everywhere/ in your set of Org-mode
     files. The software is [[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg/blob/master/lazyblorg.org][currently in development]]. However, basic
     functionality is working: tagging, Atom feeds, basic Org-mode
     syntax parser with Pandoc fall-back, hidden blog entries,
     auto-tags for language, tag cloud link page, tag description
     pages, and such. You can take a look at [[http://karl-voit.at/][Karl Voit]]'s personal web
     page to see an example result. Great features are planned for the
     future: auto-tags for article length, overview pages for
     navigation, extremely easy integration of image files through [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs/blob/master/docs/memacs_filenametimestamps.org][a
     memacs module]], and so forth.

- [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] :: Fast static blog engine which supports Org files natively.

- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] :: An Org exporter backend which exports to
     [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]]/Blackfriday-friendly Markdown, along with Hugo front-matter
     in TOML or YAML. This package was developed after being aware of
     the fact that Hugo natively supports parsing Org but only partially.
     Eead more on [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/why-ox-hugo/][Why =ox-hugo=?]]

     =ox-hugo= enables writing posts for Hugo in *native Org mode*. It
     allows converting your existing Org files to blog posts with
     almost no modification. Two common Org blogging flows are
     supported:
  - Exporting multiple Org sub-trees from a single file to multiple
    Hugo posts. With this feature, one can produce a whole web site
    from a single Org file (the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][=ox-hugo= documentation site]] is one
    such example, which is generated from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/ox-hugo-manual.org][this one Org file]]). It also
    leverages Org tag and property inheritance, and much more!
  - Exporting a single Org file to a single Hugo post.

  See the package's website for complete documentation, and the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/][test
  site]] [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content-org][source]]] for hundreds of test cases and feature
  demonstrations.

- [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog/][org-static-blog]] :: This is a blog generator that focuses on being
     simple.  It has no dependency beside Emacs.  All files are simple
     Org-mode files in a directory.  The index, the archive and the
     RSS feed are automatically generated.  See [[https://bastibe.de/][Basti's]] website for an
     example.

- [[https://emacs.love/weblorg/][weblorg]] :: A static site generator particularly suitable for blogs,
  written in Emacs Lisp and with support for templates and themes. It
  requires no external dependencies. See [[https://emacs.love/weblorg/doc/][the documentation]] and the
   [[https://github.com/emacs-love/weblorg][source code]].

* Wiki tools

- [[http://ikiwiki.info/][ikiwiki]] is a web site compiler written in Perl.  In many ways, it is
  similar to Jekyll, but has closer integration with version control
  systems.  It supports blogging and has many plugins.

  There is an org mode plugin by [[http://www.golden-gryphon.com/blog/manoj/blog/2008/06/08/Using_org-mode_with_Ikiwiki/][Manoj]], which lets you write your posts in
  Org and converts them to HTML suitable for processing by ikiwiki.

  There is [[https://github.com/chrismgray/ikiwiki-org-plugin][another plugin]] by Chris Gray that interprets Org files.  It
  is still under intermittent development, but is stable enough for
  general use.

- <<org-ehtml>>[[https://github.com/eschulte/org-ehtml][Org-ehtml]] defines an editable HTML backend for the new exporting
  engine.  Org-ehtml runs on an [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs-web-server][Emacs web server]].  Exported Org-mode
  web pages may be edited through a web browser; the edits may then be
  saved to Org-mode files on the computer running the server, and may
  even be committed to a version control system (experimental)
  providing wiki functionality.  There is also experimental support
  for password authentication.  Also see the [[https://list.orgmode.org/87pq6ua0kk.fsf@gmx.com][initial announcement
  email on the Org-mode mailing list]].

* Other tools

- [[file:org-tutorials/org-ruby.org][org-ruby]] is a Ruby gem for converting Org-mode files to HTML. The goal is
  to make it easier to use Org-mode files in website tools like [[http://webby.rubyforge.org/][Webby]],
  [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]], or [[http://webgen.rubyforge.org/][webgen]].
