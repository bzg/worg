** Conventions about content?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: conventions-about-content
  :END:

Where you want to follow a documentation convention you may consider the
[[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/tree/doc/Documentation_Standards.org][Org documentation standards]].

* How do I link to other Worg files?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: creating-links
  :END:

Links to other Worg pages should have the following format:

: [[file:index.org][Worg's home page]]

This link will converted to a relative html link on export that looks
like this:

[[file:index.org][Worg's home page]]

The filename should be a relative path. Thus, if you are creating a
link to the index from within the org-tutorials directory, you should
enter the path as follows:

: [[file:../index.org][Worg's home page]]

The easiest way to create links to files is by typing =C-c C-l= while
editing an org file. This will prompt you for both components of the
link. (Be sure to enter =file:= before the path; this indicates the
type of link.)

To enter file links more easily, you can simply type =C-u C-c C-l=. This
will allow you to locate the file using emacs' built-in completion
facilities and will automatically add the =file:= prefix.

One note of caution here: the path of the resulting link created
depends on the setting of =org-link-file-path-type=. To ensure that you
always use relative links, you can add the following to your =.emacs=
file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-link-file-path-type 'relative)
#+end_src

See also: [[info:org#External links][External links]] in the Org manual for details on how to link
to a specific location within another Worg page.

* What is the default header for new files?

You can find a default header here: [[file:worg-header.org][worg-header.org]]

* How do I create a file?

Just create it.  Before committing changes in Worg, make sure you add
the file to the repository index with =git add *.org=.

* What about dynamic blocks

If you are using dynamic blocks in Worg, please don't forget to add the
relevant code in the [[file:code/elisp/worg.el][code/elisp/worg.el]] file.  See for example the dynamic
block for the timestamp in the [[file:index.org][index]] page.

* What about macros

If you are using macros, please add them to =macros.setupfile=.

** COMMENT Defined macros explained

*** Environments

    - BeginMiniPage ... EndMiniPage :: creates a mini page with a border. Used to
         demonstrate layouts (see: [[file:./org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.org]] for
         an example).

    - BeginInfoBox ... EndInfoBox :: inserts a box with a little info icon on the
         left. The text inside flows around the icon. Both, info and warning boxes,
         use the styles for =.org-info-box= in [[file:style/worg.css][worg.css]].

    - BeginWarningBox ... EndWarningBox :: Like =BeginInfoBox= and =EndInfoBox=. The
         icon used is different.

    - BeginBlindText ... EndBlindText :: creates a =<span></span>= element, that
         greys out the text. Used for text that is there just to fill paragraphs
         to demonstrate text flow (see:
         [[file:./org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.org]] for an example).

* COMMENT How do I link to the Org version of the file?

The raw Org versions of the files are published [[https://orgmode.org/worg/sources/][here]].
