* Is my question already a Frequently Asked Questions ?

You can find answers by asking on the mailing list, but people will
probably direct you here, so it is safer to start by checking this
FAQ.

* What is org-mode?

** Can Org-mode do "x"? Does org have "x" feature?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: can-org-do-x
   :END:

In its default setup, Org-mode offers a simple outlining and task
management environment. But it also has a huge number of features and
settings "under the hood." Advanced users have configured Org-mode for
almost every conceivable use scenario.

Org-mode has a very active community and rich and extensive
documentation. Before emailing the mailing list to ask whether
Org-mode has a particular feature or setting, please consult the
following:

 - Read/search the manual.

   - https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html

     - Make sure to check out the following indexes:

       - [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Main-Index.html#Main-Index][Main Index]]
       - [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Key-Index.html#Key-Index][Key Index]]
       - [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Variable-Index.html#Variable-Index][Variable Index]]

   - The manual is also easily available from within emacs.

     To read the manual within emacs, you can evaluate =(info
     "(org)")= within emacs---i.e., type =C-x C-e= after the closing
     paragraph of the info expression above.

     You can also type =M-x info= and navigate to "Org Mode".

     You can search the entire manual by typing ~C-s term~. Keep
     pressing ~C-s~ to cycle through the results

 - Search the mailing list archives at [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/][lists.gnu.org]] or
   [[https://orgmode.org/list/][orgmode.org/list]].

   There is a good chance that the feature you are looking for has
   already been discussed (most likely several times).

 - Check for features from within emacs.

   - Emacs has a wonderful built-in help system.

   - You can browse (and change) most customization options by typing
     =M-x org-customize=.

   - You can check for a feature by typing =M-x apropos [RET] [word]= or
     =C-h a word=. This will search for all functions and variables
     matching the term (or regexp) you enter.

   - You can browse (and search for) org functions, variables, and
     faces by using =M-x describe-variable= (=C-h v=), =M-x
     describe-function= (=C-h f=), or =M-x describe-face=.

     After invoking one of these commands, simply type =org-[TAB]= to
     see a full list of relevant functions or variables or faces. You
     can then drill down further: e.g., =org-export-[TAB]= for export
     features.

 - Checkout the [[file:org-tutorials/index.org][tutorials on Worg]].

   Several of these tutorials discuss advanced features (e.g.,
   searching, custom agenda commands, tables, publishing) of Org-mode
   in depth.

   There are many other resources on Worg as well:

** Can I implement a GTD workflow with Org-mode?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: GTD-workflow-with-Org-mode
   :END:

#+index: GTD!Workflow

   Yes, you can.  Check for discussions and pointers [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-gtd-etc.html][here]].

** What is the difference between Org and TaskPaper?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Org-and-TaskPaper
   :END:

#+index: TaskPaper

  There is really no difference.  Org is as /simple/ as [[http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper][TaskPaper]].  It
  is just that, when using Org within Emacs, it lets you do many things
  that you wouldn't be able to do with TaskPaper.  Yes, TaskPaper is
  fiddle-proof and people using Emacs tends to like fiddling (which is
  orthogonal to the idea of using todo-lists efficiently), but this is
  just a matter of discipline and common sense, not one of Org's design.

  Read [[https://orgmode.org/list/0277B507-1486-4172-B1C6-1B73B84148DD@science.uva.nl][Carsten's enlightening statement]] on this.
** What is the meaning of the Unicorn on Org's website?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: unicorn
   :END:

#+index: Unicorn

The Unicorn is the logo of Org-mode because:

- Org-mode is the UNICs of ORgaNizers.

- Org-mode is an Emacs mode, so it makes sense to use an animal
  similar or related to the gnu used for GNU Emacs.

- Org-mode is meant to show you the way, and an animal with two horns
  can not do this very well, can it?

- Unicorn tears are said to reverse petrification, and wasn't this how
  we all felt before getting to some degree of time and task
  management?

- It will take forever to learn everything there is to know about a
  unicorn.

- A unicorn is a fabulous creature.  Org-mode wants to be a fabulous
  creation.

Using a unicorn was originally /Bastien Guerry's/ idea.  His friend,
the french artist [[http://intemperies.over-blog.com/][Christophe Bataillon]], designed the logo for us, and
/Greg Newman/ gave it a refresh some time later.  Bastien writes why
he chose a unicorn:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The first reason is not linked to the animal, but to the sounding of the
word "Unicorn" - because Org gives you a /uni/que way of producing files
in several format (HTML, LaTeX, etc.).

The second reason is that a Unicorn doesn't really exist, it is just
something you can dream about, and make others believe it does exist.
Just like the perfect organizer.
#+END_QUOTE

There was a [[https://orgmode.org/list/49A5BF02.1090400@rk-f.me][thread about unicorns]] on the mailing list.  [[https://orgmode.org/list/49A5BF02.1090400@rk-f.me][Christopher
Suckling]] posted a link showing how to make a simple foldable unicorn
(very appropriate for an outlining program!).

** Is Org's documentation written in Org?

As of January 2018, yes.  You can access the =.org= source of the manual
[[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/doc/org-manual.org][on the repository]].

Previously, Org mode documentation was written in TeXinfo, which is the
standard format for Emacs documentation. Today, the Org mode documentation is exported to TeXinfo with the ox-texinfo exporter written by Jonathan Leech-Pepin and Nicolas Goaziou.

** Is there a bibtex entry for the Org manual?

Yes.  Please evaluate this function and run =M-x

** I think my Org-mode is broken! How do I report a bug?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bug-reporting
   :END:

#+index: Bug!Report

 1. Make sure you are running [[#updating-org][the latest version of Org-mode]].

 2. Read [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Feedback.html][the Feedback section]] of the manual.

 3. Provide a minimal example that duplicates the bug.

    - Create a minimal .emacs file and start emacs with that file as
      detailed in [[#minimal-emacs][these instructions]].

    - Create a sample, minimal .org file that reliably reproduces the
      problem and post it to the mailing list.

    - Some users call this an "[[#ecm][ECM]]", a French acronym that means a
      "minimal complete example".

** What is an "ECM"?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ecm
   :END:

   #+index: ECM

   This is a French acronym used by some mailing list members; it
   stands for "Exemple Complet Minimal", or "Complete Minimal
   Example". The term refers to test files that can reliably reproduce
   a bug with the minimal amount of code. When you report a bug to the
   mailing list, you should provide a minimal .org file (with no more
   text than necessary) that demonstrates the bug. See [[https://orgmode.org/list/80oc3s13rg.fsf@somewhere.org][this post]] for
   more information.

** What should I do before contacting the mailing list?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: when-to-contact-mailing-list
   :END:

   The Org-mode mailing list is a high volume list, in which community
   members discuss use cases, configuration, bugs, and developments.

   If you are new to Org-mode, please read/search the excellent [[https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][manual]]
   (and pay special attention to the indexes) before asking your
   question.

   You should also search the mailing list at [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/][lists.gnu.org]] or
   [[https://orgmode.org/list/][orgmode.org/list]] to see if your issue has already been discussed.

   See [[#can-org-do-x][this faq]] for more details.

** Why hasn't my email to the mailing list shown up yet?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ml-post-delay
   :END:

   The org-mode mailing list is moderated. Thus, if you are not
   subscribed to the mailing list, your mail will only appear on the
   list after it has been approved by a moderator. To ensure that your
   mail appears quickly, please [[http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][subscribe to the list]].

** I read the mailing list through gmane. Should I subscribe?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ml-subscription-and-gmane
   :END:

   #+index: Gmane

   The org-mode mailing list is available via nntp at
   =news.gmane.io/gmane.emacs.orgmode=.  Many participants in the list
   prefer to read the list in a newsreader, such as Gnus, instead of
   receiving emails.  If you choose to read the list via nntp, you can
   still [[http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][subscribe]] to the list and then opt not to receive any emails
   on the mailman settings page (see the "Mail Delivery" setting).

   This will ensure that your messages to the list get through
   quickly, reduce the work load of the mailing list moderators (who
   need to clear every mail from non-members), and provide more
   accurate information about the number of list readers.

** My Emacs ships with an older version Org-mode! How do I upgrade?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: updating-org
   :END:

#+index: Upgrade

Org-mode develops quickly, which means that versions of Org-mode
shipped with Emacs are more or less out-of-date. If you'd like to
upgrade to the most recent version of org-mode, you have a number of
options.

 1. Download the [[https://orgmode.org/index.html#sec-3][most recent release]] of org-mode as zip or tarball and
    follow the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html#Installation][installation instructions]] in the manual.
 2. Clone and install the development git repository as [[#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development][explained
    here]]. If you don't want to run the bleeding edge, you can still
    use git [[#using-stable-releases-only][to track the most recent stable releases]].
 3. Install and updated org-mode automatically through the Emacs
    Package Manager as [[#installing-via-elpa][explained in this FAQ]].

/Note/: Please also see [[#mixed-install][Is my Orgmode installation mixed?]] for a common
issue with mixed installations.

** How do I keep current with bleeding edge development?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development
   :END:

#+index: Bleeding Edge

   Org-mode is developed in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)][Git]]. You can keep up-to-date with Org-mode
   developement by cloning the Org-mode repository and refreshing your
   copy with latest changes whenever you wish. You only need to use
   two Git commands (clone and pull.) Here are the steps in brief
   (assuming a POSIX compatible shell and please customize locations
   to suit your setup):

   1. Select a location to house the Org-mode repository (approx. 40
      MB; includes documentation, compiled elisp files and history
      going all the way back to v4.12a)

      : $ mkdir $HOME/elisp && cd $HOME/elisp

   2. Clone the Org-mode Git repository.

      Recommended approach:

      : $ git clone git@code.orgmode.org:bzg/org-mode.git

      (See [[file:worg-about.org::#contribute-to-worg][The first time you contribute to Worg]] for how to gain access).

   3. Compile and install Org-mode and build documentation.

      : $ cd $HOME/elisp/org-mode && make

      Please note that you can choose to /not/ compile at all and run
      using source =.el= files only (compiled files speed things up),
      but you will still need to generate the autoload files.

      : $ cd $HOME/elisp/org-mode && make uncompiled

      If you'd like to install org-mode someplace outside the source
      tree (private or system-wide), you should edit =local.mk= to
      point to the appropriate install location.  You may need
      administrator rights to do a system-wide installation.

      : $ cd $HOME/elisp/org-mode && make install

   4. This is where you configure Org-mode with Emacs.  Please refer
      to [[./org-tutorials/index.org][Org tutorials]].

   5. Keeping up-to-date.

      Cloning the repository is a one time activity.  From this point
      onwards you only need to /pull/ the latest changes, which the
      Makefile is set up to do automatically for certain make targets.

      : $ cd $HOME/elisp/org-mode && make update

      or if you immediately want to install as well

      : $ cd $HOME/elisp/org-mode && make update2

      Actually in this case it is recommended to run the test suite
      before installation so that you don't install a version that
      fails testing.

      : $ cd $HOME/elisp/org-mode && make up2

   6. You should reload Org-mode to have the changes take effect (if
      you are not restarting Emacs, which is recommended).  Also since
      the intention is to "keep up" with Org-mode, you should visit
      updated sections of documentation for latest updates (use =git
      log=.)

   7. As you use your repository over time it will accumulate loose objects.
      You can reduce the total size of your git repository with

      : $ git gc

      which will consolidate loose git objects into pack files.  This
      reduces the size of the repository and speeds up data access to
      the objects.

** How do I update the info manual pages to the latest org-mode version?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: update-info-manual-to-latest
   :END:

   *This is not a problem if org-mode is installed system-wide, which
   automatically takes care of this issue!* Since org-mode already
   ships with Emacs, a rather common problem among users is "How do I
   update the info documentation to the latest version of org-mode?".
   There are three ways to achieve this if for whatever reason you
   can't install into the standard, system-wide info directory:

   1. You can set the =INFOPATH= environment variable in your login
      script like this:

      #+begin_src shell-script :eval no
        # ~/.bash_profile
        export INFOPATH=/path/to/org-mode/info:$INFOPATH
        ...
      #+end_src

      =/path/to/org-mode/info= is wherever you install org-mode.

   2. You can achieve the same with elisp like this:

      #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
        ;; Info directory
        (add-to-list 'Info-additional-directory-list
                     (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/info"))
      #+end_src

   3. You should specify the same location in the Makefile while
      installing org-mode like this:

      #+begin_src makefile-gmake :eval no
        # Where local software is found
        prefix=/path/to/emacs-root
        ...
        # Where info files go.
        infodir = $(prefix)/share/info
      #+end_src

** How can I keep local changes and still track Org-mode development?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: keeping-local-changes-current-with-Org-mode-development
   :END:

  There is no need to do this anymore for the purpose of adapting the
  build system to the local environment, since this can now be
  specified in =local.mk=.  However, there may be a need to make other
  local changes to Org.

  Say you want to make minor changes to the =org.el= or any other
  version controlled file from Org and you want to keep these changes
  on top of the =master= branch from Org.  Create a local branch for
  your changes on top of origin/master as follows:

  : $ git checkout -b local origin/master
  : $ git config branch.local.rebase true
  : # Make your changes to the sources and create a new commit
  : $ git commit -am 'My local changes to Org'
  : # Update to a newer version
  : $ git pull

  Now each time you pull new commits from the distribution repository
  your local commits will be rewound and replayed on top of the new
  origin/master.  You would normally work on your =local= branch which
  includes your custom commits; there's no need to switch back to the
  =master= branch.

  If you get a conflict during a =git pull= (a change in Org and one
  of your local changes try to alter the same line of code) you will
  need to edit the file with the conflict to fix up the conflicting
  lines and then tell git that you have resolved the conflict:

  1. =git pull= fails with a conflict
  2. edit the file: look for the conflict markers =>>>>>>>= and
     =<<<<<<<= and either keep one version or create a new one and
     remove all conflict markers while doing this.
  3. =git add= the file to the index to mark the conflict resolved
  4. =git rebase --continue=
  5. lather, rinse, and repeat 2-4 as needed

  Note that it is possible to have silent conflicts when a change in
  Org and one of your local changes do not edit the same line of code,
  but are logically incompatible — for example Org might have changed
  to assume /roses are red/ while you've made a local change that
  defines /my roses are yellow/ in some other place.  Git will not
  warn you about such conflicts (it doesn't understand what the code
  _does_, of course).

  At anytime during the rebase conflict resolution you can say "oops
  this is all wrong - put it back the way it was before I did a pull"
  using
: $ git rebase --abort

** How can I use a stable release version instead of the bleeding edge master?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: using-stable-releases-only
   :END:

The =master= branch of the git repository always contains the bleeding
edge development code.  This is important for Org's fast development,
because code on master gets checked out by many people daily and we
quickly receive bug reports if something is wrong.  On rare occasions,
this code may not function perfectly for a limited time while we are
trying to fix things.  It is therefore recommended to keep a
known-good version of org-mode installed outside the source tree and
always run the full test suite before using a new version from master.

Not everyone like to use this bleeding-edge code and face the danger
to hit a surprising bug.  The branch =maint= is specifically for
collecting only fixes for known bugs between releases.  If you don't
want to wait for a new release, but don't want to live on the bleeding
edge, consider using =maint=.

From time to time, we make a release by merging all the new features
from =master= into =maint=.  This typically happens when the
maintainers feel that

1. they have reached a good point in the development
2. the code has a feature set that should stay and be supported in the
   future

Stable releases are used as the basis for [[https://orgmode.org/index.html#sec-3_3][alternative distributions]] of
Org, and they are also the code that gets merged into the Emacs
distribution. If you want to work only with stable releases, you can
always download [[https://orgmode.org/index.html#sec-3][them here]], but you can also also use the git
repository to keep automatically up-to-date with the most recent
stable releases (and save bandwidth!). Here's how to do so:

*** Run a specific stable release

In the repository, do

: $ git fetch --tags
: $ git tag

To see which release tags are available.  Let's say you decide to use
=release_7.01f=.

: $ git checkout release_7.01f

This set the working tree of the repository to the state of Org at the
moment of release 7.01f.  You can then run Org from the repository be
sure to use the stable release while development continues on the
master branch.

Later, when we release 7.02, you can switch to that using

: $ git fetch --tags                   # to get all the new stuff
: $ git tag
: $ git checkout release_7.02

*** Always run the most recent stable release

Alternatively, if you just want to always run whatever the latest
stable release is, you can do

: $ git checkout -b stable origin/maint

and then regularly update this branch by doing

: $ git pull

** How can I install an up-to-date version of org-mode without "make" tools?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installing-org-without-make-tools
   :END:

If you are using org-mode on a computer that lacks developer tools for
compiling software, such as [[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU Make]], you will have to use a
*different* installation method than [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html#Installation][the one outlined in the manual]].
Please see this description for [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-hacks.html#compiling-org-without-make][compiling org-mode without make]] so you
can install a recent version of org-mode without using the full build
system.

** I don't use git. Can I download bleeding edge .zip and .tar.gz archives?

   Yes. You can download [[https://orgmode.org/org-latest.zip][org-latest.zip]] or [[https://orgmode.org/org-latest.tar.gz][org-latest.tar.gz]] of Org-mode --
   these archives are updated every day at midnight.

   Alternatively, you can download a [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/releases][tar.gz release archive]].

** How do I install Org-mode through Emacs' Package Manager?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installing-via-elpa
   :END:

   Daily builds of Org-mode are distributed as an ELPA package from both
   [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/][GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive]] as well as from the [[https://orgmode.org/elpa/][Org-mode Emacs Lisp
   Archive]].

   Steps for installing Org with package manager:
   1) Do =M-x list-packages= to browse available packages.
   2) If the above command is unavailable you need to [[#installing-elpa][install the package
      manager]] before proceeding ahead.
   3) If you see =org= as an available package, skip to step 5.

** How do I install Emacs package manager?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installing-elpa
   :END:

   If you are running Emacs 24 or find the command =M-x list-packages=
   available you already have the package manager installed.

   Steps for installing package manager on emacs-23:

   1. Download the package manager [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=emacs.git;a=blob_plain;hb=ba08b24186711eaeb3748f3d1f23e2c2d9ed0d09;f=lisp/emacs-lisp/package.el][package.el]]

   2. Add the following to your =.emacs= and reload Emacs.
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        ;; change "~/elisp/" as appropiate
        (setq load-path (cons "~/elisp" load-path))

        ;; Add the below lines *at the beginning* of your .emacs.
        (require 'package)
        (package-initialize)
      #+end_src

** I don't see Org-mode as an installation option in Package Manager Menu?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: why-no-org-in-elpa
   :END:

   Emacs Package Manager is a very recent addition to Emacs. Work is
   under way to have have Org-mode seamlessly integrate with Emacs'
   Package Manager. As a result, it will be some time before the
   Org-mode packages are available and usable from either GNU or
   Org-mode package archives.

   In the meanwhile, you can install Org-mode via package manager
   through ELPA-compatible tar. Refer [[#installing-from-elpa-tarball][to this FAQ entry]] for more
   information.

** How do I install Org-mode from a ELPA-compatible tarball?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installing-from-elpa-tarball
   :END:

#+index: ELPA

   Org-mode is distributed as an ELPA-compatible tar which can be used
   in conjunction with Emacs' package manager.

   1. If you are already running Org-mode, note the current version
      reported by M-x org-version.
   2. Download the latest tarball from [[https://orgmode.org/elpa/][Org-mode repo]].
   3. Do =M-x package-install-file=. When prompted for =Package file
      name=, point it to .tar file downloaded in step 2.

      You will now see Package Manager compiling the files and
      installing it.
   4. Reload emacs. This step is very important.
   5. Note the version of the new installation using M-x
      org-version. If the new and old versions are different, the
      installation is done and you are all set to enjoy the updated
      Org-mode. Otherwise skip to step 6.
   6. Review you load-path using =C-h v load-path=. Most likely that
      your old installation path takes precedence over the path chosen
      by package manager (which is typically
      =~/.emacs.d/elpa/...=). Fix this anamoly by moving
      =(package-initialize)= line in .emacs to a more appropriate
      location.

** Why would I use ELPA tarballs instead of the snapshot tarballs?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: why-elpa
   :END:

#+index: ELPA

   ELPA-tarballs automate much the process of upgrading org-mode. Much
   of the following grunt work is done automatically by the Package
   Manager:

   1. Downloading, compiling, and activating of org-mode (including
      setting org-mode's =load-path= and autoloads).
   2. Updating info files.

** Can I use the editing features of org-mode in other modes?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-editing-features-in-other-modes
   :END:

   Not really---but there are a few editing features you can use in
   other modes.

   - For tables there is =orgtbl-mode= which implements the table
     editor as a minor mode. (To enable, type =M-x orgtbl-mode=)
   - For ordered lists there is =orgstruct-mode= which allows for easy
     list editing as a minor mode. (To enable, type =M-x
     orgstruct-mode=)

   You can activate these modes automatically by using hooks:

   : (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)
   : (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)

   For footnotes, there is the function =org-footnote-action=, which
   works in non-org buffers. This function is a powerful tool for
   creating and sorting footnotes. To use it globally, you can add the
   following keybinding to your =.emacs= file (requires Org 6.17 or
   greater):

   : (global-set-key (kbd "C-c f") 'org-footnote-action)

   For other features you need to switch to Org-mode temporarily, or
   prepare text in a different buffer.

** Why isn't feature "X" working the way it is described in the manual?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: making-sure-org-mode-is-up-to-date
   :END:

Org-mode develops very quickly. If you are using a version of Org-mode
that shipped with emacs, there is a good chance that it is somewhat
out of date.

Many of the users on the Org-mode mailing list are using either a
recent release of Org-mode or the
[[https://orgmode.org/index.html#sec-3.2][development version of
org-mode from the git repository]].

If some settings and features aren't working the way you expect, make
sure that the version of the manual you are consulting matches the
version of Org-mode you are using.

   - You can check which version of Org-mode you are using by
     selection =Org --> Documentation --> Show Version= in the Emacs
     menu.

   - The [[https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][online manual]] at [[https://orgmode.org][orgmode.org]] corresponds to the most recent
     release.

   - The [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/index.html][manual]] at [[http://www.gnu.org][www.gnu.org]] corresponds to the version of Org-mode
     released with the latest official Gnu Emacs release. Compared
     with the manual at the orgmode.org, the manual at www.gnu.org is
     somewhat out of date.

For instructions on how to stay current with Org-mode, consult [[#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development][this
FAQ]] or follow the instructions on [[https://orgmode.org][the official Org-mode site]].

** Can I get the visibility-cycling features in emacs-lisp-mode?

Yes.  This snippet in your =.emacs= will bind =C-M-]= and =M-]= to global
and local cycling:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-]") (lambda () (interactive) (org-cycle t)))
(global-set-key (kbd "M-]") (lambda ()
                              (interactive)
                              (ignore-errors
				(end-of-defun)
				(beginning-of-defun))
                              (org-cycle)))
#+END_SRC

** Can I get the visibility-cycling features in outline-mode and outline-minor-mode?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-visibility-cycling-in-outline-mode
   :END:

#+index: Visibility!Cycling

   Yes, these functions are written in a way that they are independent of
   the outline setup.  The following setup provides standard Org-mode
   functionality in outline-mode on =TAB= and =S-TAB=.  For
   outline-minor-mode, we use =C-TAB= instead of =TAB=,
   because =TAB= usually has mode-specific tasks.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (define-key outline-minor-mode-map [(control tab)] 'org-cycle)
    (define-key outline-minor-mode-map [(shift tab)] 'org-global-cycle)))
(add-hook 'outline-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (define-key outline-mode-map [(tab)] 'org-cycle)
    (define-key outline-mode-map [(shift tab)] 'org-global-cycle)))
#+END_SRC

Or check out /outline-magic.el/, which does this and also provides
promotion and demotion functionality.  /outline-magic.el/ is
available at [[http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/outline-magic.el][Outline Magic]].

** Can I save and restore the visibility state of an org-mode buffer?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: saving-visibility-state
   :END:

#+index: Visibility!Restore

Well, no---at least not automatically. You can, however, control the
visibility of an org-file or of individual trees by adding
instructions to your org file. See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Visibility-cycling.html#Visibility-cycling][this section of the manual]] for more
information.

** How can I keep track of changes in my Org files?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: track-of-changes-in-Org-files
   :END:

  Use git to track the history of the files, use a cronjob to check in
  changes regularly.  Such a setup is described by Bernt Hansen in
  [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tzilzgkv.fsf@gollum.intra.norang.ca][this message]].

** Can I use Org-mode as the default mode for all README files?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Org-mode-as-default-mode
   :END:

#+index: default-major-mode

Add the following to your .emacs file:

: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("README$" . org-mode))

You can even make it the default mode for any files with unspecified
mode using

: (setq default-major-mode 'org-mode)

** Can I use ido.el for completing stuff in Org?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ido-complete
   :END:

#+index: Ido

   Yes, you can.  If you are an ido user and ido-mode is active, the
   following setting will make Org use =ido-completing-read= for most
   of its completing prompts.

: (setq org-completion-use-ido t)

** Should I use one big org file or multiple files?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-organize-org-mode-files
   :END:

Org-mode is flexible enough to accomodate a variety of organizational and
time management schemes.  Org's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Document-structure.html#Document-structure][outline cycling and convenient editing and
navigation commands]] make it possible to maintain all of your projects and
notes in a single file.  But org-mode's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html#Hyperlinks][quick and easy hyperlinks]], along
with [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-copy.html#Refile-and-copy][easy refiling of notes and todos]], also make it a delight to maintain a
private "wiki" consisting of multiple files.

No matter how you organize your org files, org-mode's agenda commands
make it easy to search all your notes and gather together crucial data
in a single view.

Moreover, several org-mode settings can be configured either globally in
your =.emacs= file or locally (per file or per outline tree).  See the
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html#Top][manual]] for more details.  For an example of local customizations see [[#limit-agenda-with-category-match][this
FAQ]].

Here are a few ideas for organizing org-mode files:

- A single file for all your projects and notes.
- One file per project.
- One file per client.
- One file per area of responsibility or type of work (e.g.,
  household, health, work, etc.).
- One file for projects, one for appointments, one for reference
  material, one for someday/maybe items, etc.
- A wiki of hyperlinked files that grows and adapts to meet your
  needs.

For more ideas, see some of the links on the [[file:org-tutorials/index.org][org-tutorial index]] or
[[file:org-gtd-etc.org][this page on org-mode and GTD]].

** Why doesn't C-c a call the agenda? Why don't some org keybindings work?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: setting-global-keybindings
   :END:

Org-mode has a few global keybindings that the user must set explicitly in
an =.emacs= file.  These keybindings include the customary shortcut for
calling the agenda (=C-c a=).  If nothing happens when you type =C-c a=,
then make sure that the following lines are in your =.emacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; The following lines are always needed.  Choose your own keys.
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
  (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
  (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
  (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+END_SRC

You may, of course, choose whatever keybindings work best for you
and do not conflict with other modes.

Please see [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Activation.html][this section of the manual]] if you have additional
questions.

** Why aren't some of the variables I've customized having an effect?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: load-org-after-setting-variables
   :END:

Some org variables have to be set before org.el is loaded or else they
will not work. (An example is the new variable
=org-enforce-todo-dependencies=.)

You should also make sure that you do not require any other =org-...=
files in your =.emacs= file before you have set your org variables,
since these will also cause org.el to be loaded. To be safe, load org
files *after* you have set your variables.

** How can I make sure that timestamps appear in English?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: timestamps-and-system-time-locale
   :END:

If your system's locale is not set to English, but you would like the
timestamps in your org-mode files to appear in English, you can set
the following variable:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq system-time-locale "C")
#+end_src

** What does a minimal .emacs look like?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: minimal-emacs
   :END:

Using a stripped down minimal .emacs files removes broken custom
settings as the cause of an issue and makes it easy to reproduce for
other people.  The example below has system-specific paths that you'll
need to change for your own use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/git/org-mode/lisp"))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.\\(org\\  |org_archive\\|txt\\)$" . org-mode))
  (setq org-agenda-files '("/tmp/test.org"))
  (require 'org)
  (require 'org-habit)

  (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
  (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
  (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+end_src

You can save the minimal .emacs file to ~/minimal.emacs, add suspect
configuration code to it, then start emacs something like this:

#+begin_src sh
emacs -Q -l ~/minimal.emacs
#+end_src

On OS X, starting emacs with minimal configuration might look
something like this:

#+begin_src sh
/Applications/emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -Q -l ~/minimal.emacs
#+end_src

** What is the best setup for indenting?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: indentation
   :END:

Indentation, both appearance and behavior, is a matter of personal
preferences.  You may try if the following adjustments suits better
for you than the defaults.  Set ~org-adapt-indentation~ to have
content aligned to headline titles.  Disable ~electric-indent-mode~ to
avoid automatic indentation in response to =RET= key.

In more details, ~org-adapt-indentation~ controls indentation with
regards to previous element.  Apparent effect is increased indentation
for content of deeper nested headings.  The variable accepts three
values: =nil= (no special indentation), =t= (always indent relatively
to the element above) and =headline-data= (only indent the
~PROPERTIES/LOGBOOK~ drawers relatively to the current level).  Value
=t= is suitable for short entries especially if you plan to share your
documents with someone who does not use Emacs.  If you just want to
make heading level more prominent then consider adding visual left
margin using =#+STARTUP: indent= as described in the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Clean-View.html#Clean-View][Clean View]]
section of the manual.  The option works without adding extra spaces
to the document text.

Configured indentation may be applied in response to =RET= or to
=C-j= depending on the state of ~electric-indent-mode~.  The following
tables summarizes the difference.  Version number is added to column
header if it describes default settings.

With ~electric-indent-mode~ enabled:

| org-adapt-indentation =>  | nil (Org >= 9.5)       | t (Org 9.4)                | headline-data              |
|---------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------|
| RET after a headline      | Do not indent          | Indent                     | Do not indent              |
| C-j after a headline      | Do not indent          | Do not indent              | Do not indent              |
| RET elsewhere             | Indent wrt previous    | Indent wrt previous        | Indent wrt previous        |
| C-j elsewhere             | Do not indent wrt prev | Do not indent wrt previous | Do not indent wrt previous |
| Insert PROPERTIES/LOGBOOK | Do not indent          | Indent wrt headline        | Indent wrt headline        |

With ~electric-indent-mode~ disabled:

| org-adapt-indentation =>  | nil                 | t                          | headline-data (Org < 9.4)  |
|---------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------|
| RET after a headline      | Do not indent       | Do not indent              | Do not indent              |
| C-j after a headline      | Do not indent       | Indent                     | Do not indent              |
| RET elsewhere             | Do not indent       | Do not indent wrt previous | Do not indent wrt previous |
| C-j elsewhere             | Indent wrt previous | Indent wrt previous        | Indent wrt previous        |
| Insert PROPERTIES/LOGBOOK | Do not indent       | Indent wrt headline        | Indent wrt headline        |

Do not try to avoid or to ignore indentation of heading body or
properties drawer determined by current state of
~org-adapt-indentation~ and ~electric-indent-mode~ by pressing =C-j=
instead of =RET= (or vice versa). The result is transient and you will
lose formatting when you refile heading or change its level (promote
or demote it).

You may have noticed recommendation to disable ~electric-indent-mode~
to restore behavior prior to Org 9.4.  In Org 9.5
~org-adapt-indentation~ default value changed to =nil= and, more
importantly, a number of bugs related to indentation were fixed.
Using =RET= with enabled ~electric-indent-mode~ should be convenient
now.  Just customize ~org-adapt-indentation~ variable accordingly to
you preferences.

** Is my Orgmode installation mixed?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mixed-install
   :END:
   Emacs is distributed with a version of Orgmode bundled with it.  A
   common problem among users who install a [[#updating-org][newer version]] of Orgmode
   separately is a mixed install where Emacs loads some files from the
   bundled and the rest from the latest version.  This can lead to
   /unending/ troubles in the future.  With a recent installation of
   Org mode =M-x org-version= will indicate if the installation is mixed.

   With somewhat older Org mode installations, the procedure is more
   involved and indeterminate. An easy first step is to look
   at the output of =M-x org-version=.
   - Good :: ~Org-mode version 7.8.11 (release_7.8.11-448-g1737d3 @
             /path/to/org-mode/lisp/)~
   - Bad :: ~Org-mode version 6.33x (release_7.8.11.409.ga3778)~

   A second step is to go through the output of =list-load-path-shadows=
   line-by-line to get hints to what in your configuration is causing
   the issue.  Among the most common reasons is Orgmode gets loaded
   before the =load-path= variable is updated to include the
   installation directory of the latest Orgmode.  To avoid issues like
   this, it is recommended that the load path is updated very early on
   in your init file.

   /Note:/ The formatting of the version information, as shown in the
   examples above, will be different for older Org mode releases,
   e.g. ~Org-mode version 7.8.02~.

** Opening Org files in Emacs leads to a crash
   :PROPERTIES:

   The only known case where Org-mode can crash Emacs is when you are
   using =org-indent-mode= with Emacs 23.1 (in fact, any version of
   Emacs before version 23.1.50.3).  Upgrade to Emacs 23.2 and the
   problem should go away.

** How can I control the application launched by Org-mode to open a certain file type like pdf, html...?
   :PROPERTIES:

If you want special control about how Org-mode opens files, see the
variables =org-file-apps=, =org-file-apps-defaults-gnu=,
=org-file-apps-defaults-macosx=, =org-file-apps-defaults-windowsnt=.

*However*, normally it is best to just use the mechanism the
operating-system provides:

*** GNU/Linux systems
    You you have to check your mailcap settings, find the files:

    : /etc/mailcap
    :
    : or
    :
    : $HOME/.mailcap

and modify them accordingly. Please read their manual entry.

*** Windows systems
    + for html pages you may configure the =browse-url-= variables through
      the Customize interface,
    + the pdf files are automatically opened with Acrobat Reader (if it is
      installed)

*** Mac OSX
    Change the application responsible for this file type by selecting
    such a file in the Finder, select =File->Get Info= from the menu
    and select the application to open this file with.  Then, to
    propagate the change to all files with the same extension, select
    the =Change all= button.

** Org-mode takes over the TAB key.  I also want to use YASnippet, is there a way to fix this conflict?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: YASnippet
   :END:

[[http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/][yasnippet]] is yet another snippet expansion system for Emacs.  It is
inspired by TextMate's templating syntax.
- watch the [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj7btx3ATg][video on YouTube]]
- see the [[http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html][intro and tutorial]]

*Note*: yasnippet is not compatible with =org-indent-mode= currently
there is no known way to use both successfully with =yas/trigger-key=
set to =TAB= (or =[tab]= etc...)

The way Org-mode binds the =TAB= key (binding to =[tab]= instead of
=\t=) overrules yasnippets' access to this key.  The following code
fixes this problem:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (org-set-local 'yas/trigger-key [tab])
	    (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-group)))
#+end_src

If the above code doesn't work (which it may not with later versions
of yasnippet).  Then try the following

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun yas/org-very-safe-expand ()
    (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil)) (yas/expand)))

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()

** Org behaves strangely: some keys don't work, some features are missing, my settings have no effect, ...
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: loaded-old-org
   :END:

When this sort of things happen, it probably is because Emacs is
loading an old version of Org-mode instead of the one you expected.
Check it with =M-x org-version=.

This happens because Emacs loads first the system org-mode (the one
included with Emacs) before the one in your directory. Check the
=load-path= variable; you might see that your org-mode appears /after/
the system-wide path; this is bad.

You should add your directories to the =load-path= at the beginning:

:  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org-mode/lisp")

Function =add-to-list= adds at the beginning. Don't use =append= because
it appends at the end.

This wrong version loading may also happen if you have a byte-compiled
=org.elc= from an old version together with a new =org.el=. Since
Emacs prefers loading byte-compiled files (even if the =.el= is
newer), it will load the old Org-mode.

** Why doesn't org-batch-agenda work under Win32?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-batch-agenda-under-win32
   :END:

When I run the example batch files to print my agenda to the console
under Win32 I get the failure:

: End of file during parsing

and no agenda is printed.

The problem is the use of single quotes surrounding the eval in the
emacs command-line. This gets confused under Win32. All string
parameters with spaces must be surrounded in double quotes. This means
that double quotes being passed to the eval must be escaped.

Therefore, instead of the following:

: <path to emacs>\emacs.exe -batch -l ~/_emacs_org \
:     -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a")'

you need to use the following:

:  <path to emacs>\emacs.exe -batch -l ~/_emacs_org \
:     -eval "(org-batch-agenda \"a\")"

(all on one line, of course).

** Org agenda seems very slow
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: slow-agenda
   :END:

If it takes a long time to generate or refresh the agenda, you might
want first check which version of org-mode you are using. There have
been major optimizations of org-agenda since 6.21b, which was the
version of org-mode released with Emacs 23. If you are using 6.21b or
earlier (you can check with =M-x org-version=), then you might want to
consider upgrading to a more recent version of org-mode.

Here are some other ideas for speeding up the agenda:

1. Use a one day agenda view (rather than a seven day view).

   =(setq org-agenda-ndays 1)=

2. Archive inactive items to separate files.

   =C-c C-x C-s= (org-archive-subtree)

3. Do not include the global todo list in your agenda view.

   (setq org-agenda-include-all-todo nil)

4. Make sure that your org files are byte-compiled.

   I.e., make sure there are files ending in =.elc= in your org
   installation directory.

5. Limit your agenda files (=org-agenda-files=) to files that have
   active todos and or projects.

   If you have a number of older reference files---i.e., files you
   search only occasionally---in your agenda files list, consider
   removing them from your agenda files and adding them to
   =org-agenda-text-search-extra-files= instead. Similarly, you might
   consider searching some of your older reference files with =M-x
   grep= so that Org-mode does not have to load them into memory when
   the agenda is called.

** Visual-line-mode doesn't work well with Org-mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: visual-line-mode
   :END:

Visual-line-mode "soft wraps" lines so that the visual edge of the
buffer is considered a line break for purposes of navigation, even
though there is no line break in reality.

In older versions of org-mode, org-beginning-of-line and
org-end-of-line do not work well with visual line mode. (The two
commands disregard soft line breaks and move to the beginning and end
of the hard line break.) A patch was introduces to fix this behavior
in July of 2009.

If you are using an older version of Org-mode, you can:

1. Add a hook to turn off visual line mode.

2. Add the following to your =.emacs=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (define-key org-mode-map "\C-a" 'move-beginning-of-line)
    (define-key org-mode-map "\C-e" 'move-end-of-line)))

#+end_src
** Can I hide blocks at startup?

Yes:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-hide-block-startup t)
#+end_src

Or use

#+begin_src org
,#+STARTUP: hideblocks
#+end_src

on a per-file basis.

** After updating Org I get an error about an =invalid function=
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: invalid-function-error
   :END:

In almost all cases an =invalid function= error is caused by an
unclean Org-mode source directory. Cleaning it up and recompiling
should fix the problem

: cd /path/to/orgmode
: make clean
: make

In some cases, bits and pieces of org are loaded from various places (previous
installs, the built-in install of org that came with whatever emacs version you have)
and things get very confused. In all cases, cleaning up every last bit of org installation
from everywhere and reinstalling org from git should restore sanity. See also the [[id:facac2a6-3526-450d-ac42-8d36b16c6bab][next question]].

** I use starter-kit and I get an error =(void-function org-pop-to-buffer-same-window)=
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       facac2a6-3526-450d-ac42-8d36b16c6bab
   :END:
This is a particular instance of the [[#invalid-function-error][previous question]] but with some twists and turns,
and a solution culled from various postings on the mailing list.

starter-kit loads the site-file version of org (the one that came with
your emacs install).  Then when you load your init file, the local
version is added to the front of load-path, so it looks as if things
are originating there, but the damage is already done: you have a
"frankenstein" org.

One possible solution is to add (package-initialize) to the primary init.el
before starter-kit gets going. This will pick up the local install so
that the built-in version never enters to muddy the picture.

** (Filling a paragraph|Indenting a list|...) behaves strangely
Many filling/indenting problems have been reported on the mailing
list: many of those were bugs (that have been fixed), but quite a lot
are caused by people using the filladapt package, which is fundamentally
incompatible with Org, which has its own facilities for these tasks. If you see
strange behavior in this area, first check if you are using filladapt: visit an org
file and check the modeline for "Filladapt".

If filladapt is on, you want to turn it off before investigating
further. Anthony Lander suggested on the mailing list the following
method to turn off filladapt mode when you visit org files:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)
#+END_SRC

This should be placed in your .emacs (or other initialization file) after org
is loaded.

** Org-mode has a lot of colors?  How can I change them?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: customizing-org-faces
   :END:

#+index: Faces

This is a question that applies to Emacs as a whole, but it comes up
quite frequently on the org-mode mailing list, so it is appropriate to
discuss it here.

If you would like to change the style of a face in org-mode (or any
other Emacs mode), simply type =M-x customize-face [RET]= while the
cursor is on the color/style you are interested in modifying. You will
be given the opportunity to customize all the faces located at that
point.

If you would like an overview of all the faces in org-mode, you can
type =C-u M-x list-faces-display [RET] org= and you will be shown all
the faces defined by org-mode along with an illustration of their
current settings.

If you would like to customize org-faces and other aspects of
org-appearance, type =M-x customize-group org-font-lock [RET]=.

Finally, if you would like verbose information about the properties of
the text under the cursor, you can type =C-u C-x ==.

See the Worg page on [[file:org-tutorials/org-appearance.org][customizing Org appearance]] for further information.
** Why do I get a tiny font in column view when using emacs daemon?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: column-view-tiny-font
   :END:

#+index: Column view

When using emacs in daemon mode (=emacs --daemon=), client frames
sometimes override the column view face settings, resulting in very
small fonts. Here is a fix:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-column-view-uses-fixed-width-face ()
  ;; copy from org-faces.el
  (when (fboundp 'set-face-attribute)
      ;; Make sure that a fixed-width face is used when we have a column

      (set-face-attribute 'org-column nil
                          :height (face-attribute 'default :height)
                          :family (face-attribute 'default :family))))

   (when (and (fboundp 'daemonp) (daemonp))
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-column-view-uses-fixed-width-face))

** Can I close an outline section without starting a new section?

#+index: Outline

Can I have nested, closed outline sections, similar to xml? This
question comes up quite frequently on the mailing list.

See the following threads:

  - https://orgmode.org/list/20110327170251.58923564@hsdev.com
  - https://orgmode.org/list/AANLkTinaTdYWQTXLzCf2kJVOMv64OM_5tL_0JCYAssPr@mail.gmail.com

  - https://orgmode.org/list/49CE32EC.5060508@gmx.de

The desired behavior looks something like this:

#+begin_src org
,* Section one

Some text

,** Subsection one

Some text

,** Subsection two

Some text

,# end Subsection Two

Continue text in section one.
#+end_src

The short answer to the question is no. Org-mode adheres to the
cascading logic of outlines, in which a section is closed only by
another section that occupies an equal or greater level.

Here are some workarounds:

1. You can use inline tasks to create non-folding subsections. See the
   documentation in org-inlinetask.el, which is part of the org-mode
   distribution.
2. You can create a temporary heading, such as "** Continue main
   section" and then remove it when you are ready to export.
3. You can create a separate outline heading (e.g., * ACTIONS),
   creating TODOs there with links to the relevant sections of your
   main text.

** Can I add a TODO to a list item?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: list-item-as-todo
   :END:

No.  When generating agenda views, org-mode treats only headlines as TODO
items.

You can, however, use a status cookie together with checkboxes to
monitor your progress on a series of subtasks:

#+begin_src org
,** TODO Big task [1/3]

   - [X] Subtask 1
   - [ ] Subtask 2
   - [ ] Subtask 3
#+end_src

If you would like to embed a TODO within text without treating it as
an outline heading, you can use inline tasks. Simply add...

: (require 'org-inlinetask)

...to your =.emacs= and then type =C-c C-x t= to insert an inline task.

** Can I have two windows on the same Org-mode file, with different outline visibilities?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: indirect-buffers
   :END:

   You may use /indirect buffers/ which do exactly this.  See the
   documentation on the command =make-indirect-buffer=.

   Org-mode has built-in commands that allow you create an indirect
   buffer from a subtree of an outline. To open a subtree in new
   window, type =C-c C-x b=. Any changes you make in the new window
   will be saved to the original file, but the visibility of both
   buffers will remain independent of one another.

   For multiple indirect buffers from the same file, you must use the
   prefix =C-u= when creating the second (or third) buffer. Otherwise
   the new indirect buffer will replace the old.

   You can also create an independent view of an outline subtree by
   typing =b= on an item in the agenda.

** Emacs outlines are unreadable.  Can I get rid of all those stars?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Emacs-outlines-are-unreadable

   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:

   =(setq org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree t)= before losing your work.

   =(setq org-catch-invisible-edits 'show)= will also be helpful.  See the
   docstring of this option, as it allows more flexible options.

** Why aren't commands working on regions?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: transient-mark-mode
   :END:

Some org-mode commands, such as M-right and M-left for demoting or
promoting headlines (see [[#demote-multiple-headlines][this FAQ]]), can be applied to entire
regions.  These commands, however, will only work on active regions set
with [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Transient-Mark.html#Transient-Mark][transient mark mode]]. Transient mark mode is enabled by default in
Emacs 23. To enable it in earlier versions of emacs, put the following in
your =.emacs= file:

: (transient-mark-mode 1)

Alternatively, you may turn off transient mark mode and use [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Momentary-Mark.html][a momentary
mark]] (=C-<SPC> C-<SPC>=).

** Why is a blank line inserted after headlines and list items?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       2463F4D8-F686-4CF3-AA07-08976F8A4972
   :CUSTOM_ID: blank-line-after-headlines-and-list-items
   :END:

#+index: Blank

In org-mode, typing =M-RET= at the end of a headline will create a new
headline of the same level on a new line. The same is true for plain
lists. By default org-mode uses context to determine if a blank line should
be inserted after each headline or plain list item when =M-RET= is
pressed. For instance, if a there is a blank line before a headline, then
typing =M-RET= at the end of the line will insert a blank line before the
new headline. For instance, hitting =M-RET= at the end of "Headline Two"
below inserts a new headline without a blank line:

: ** Headline One
: ** Headline Two
: **

If there is a blank line between Headline One and Headline Two,
however, the results will be as follows:

: ** Headline One
:
: ** Headline Two
:
: **

If you do not like the default behavior you can change it with the
variable =org-blank-before-new-entry=. You can set headings and/or
plain lists to auto (the default setting), t (always), or nil (never).

** How can I promote or demote multiple headlines at once?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: demote-multiple-headlines
   :END:

#+index: Promote!Multiple
#+index: Demote!Multiple

If you have a long list of first level headlines that you'd like to
demote to second level headlines, you can select the headlines as a
region and then hit =M-<right>= to demote all the headlines at once.

Note: =M-S-<right>= will not work on a selected region. Its use is to
demote a single subtree (i.e., a headline and all sub-headlines).

If M-<right> doesn't seem to work, make sure transient mark mode is
enabled. See [[#transient-mark-mode][this FAQ]].

** What's the deal with all the ellipses in my org outlines?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-ellipses
   :END:

#+index: Ellipsis

Org-mode uses ellipses to indicate folded (and thus hidden) text. Most
commonly, ellispes occur at the end of headings with folded content:

: * Heading ...

Or, for instance, they may indicate closed drawers:

: :PROPERTIES: ...

Sometimes, as a result of editing and cycling an outline, ellipses may
appear in unexpected places. You should *never* delete these ellipses,
as you may accidentally delete hidden text. Instead, you can type =C-c
C-r= (org-reveal) to display all hidden text in the vicinity. Or you
may type =M-x RET show-all= to reveal all text in the org file.

If you would prefer a symbol or face for indicating hidden text, you
can customize the variable org-ellipses.

** How do I yank a subtree so it's indented according to the point's location?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: yank-indent-subtree
   :END:

#+index: Indentation

You can either use =C-c C-w= with a working [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-copy.html#Refile-and-copy][refile-targets]] setup.

Or set =org-yank-adjusted-subtrees= to =t= which will adjust the
yanked headline's level correctly.

Just use =C-k= and =C-y= as you would everywhere else in Emacs.

** Can I read org-mode outlines in vim?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-outlines-in-vim
   :END:

#+index: Vim

Yes, there is a script that enables one to view and navigate folded
outline/org files in vim (though without most of org-mode's
functionality, of course).

  - [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id%3D1266][Emacs outline mode - Imitates Emacsen : vim online]]

For instructions on how to set it up, please see [[http://orgmode.org/list/EA275862-B97A-4BAC-B879-177FD07A2D56@gaillourdet.net][this mailing list post]].

Work is also underway on an org-mode clone for Vim. You can check it
out on git hub:

https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer

** Can I use another character than "*" to start a headline?

No.  The "*" character is used in =outline-mode=, and Org is derived from
=outline-mode=.

If you are curious as to what other rationales there are for "*", check out
[[https://orgmode.org/list/8739i7ke8i.fsf@gmail.com][this]] mail and the thread it is in.

Even if you cannot use another character, you can add an overlay on top of
the "*" characters and your buffer will look like the way you want.

** How can I quickly set the tag of an entry?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: quickly-set-tag-of-entry

#+index: Tag!Set

   Use =C-c C-c= or =C-c C-q= on the headline. =C-c C-q= is useful for
   setting tabs in a =Remember= buffer, since =C-c C-c= is the default
   keybinding for filing a note from the remember buffer.

   You can set tags even more quickly by setting one of the character
   shortcuts for [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-tags.html#Setting-tags][fast tag selection]].

   To set tag shortcuts for all org buffers, put something like the
   following in your =.emacs= file (or create the same settings by
   typing =M-x customize-variable RET org-tag-alist=):

: (setq org-tag-alist '(("computer" . ?c) ("office" . ?o) ("home" . ?h)))

   To set tag shortcuts for a single buffer, put something like the
   following at the top of your org file:

: #+TAGS: computer(c) office(o) home(h)

** How can I change the colors of TODO keywords?

#+index: Faces!Todo

You can use the variable =org-todo-keyword-faces=.  Here are some sample
settings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      '(
	("TODO"  . (:foreground "firebrick2" :weight bold))
	("WAITING"  . (:foreground "olivedrab" :weight bold))
	("LATER"  . (:foreground "sienna" :weight bold))
	("PROJECT"  . (:foreground "steelblue" :weight bold))
	("DONE"  . (:foreground "forestgreen" :weight bold))
	("MAYBE"  . (:foreground "dimgrey" :weight bold))
	("CANCELED"  . shadow)
	))
#+end_src

If you want to change the color of all active todos or all inactive todos,
type:

: M-x customize-face RET org-todo
: M-x customize-face RET org-done

You can also set values for each of these in your =.emacs= file:

: (set-face-foreground 'org-todo "firebrick2")
: (set-face-foreground 'org-done "forestgreen")

** Can I use a arbitrary character in a TODO keyword?

Yes, provided you add it to the "word" syntax in Emacs.

For example, to add the =\u25b6= and the =\u25b8= chars, just add this to
your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
     (lambda ()
       (modify-syntax-entry (string-to-char "\u25b6") "w")
       (modify-syntax-entry (string-to-char "\u25b8") "w")))
#+end_src

** Why do I have to confirm the execution of each shell/elisp link?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: confirm-shell/elisp-link
   :END:

#+index: Link!Shell
#+index: Link!Elisp

   The confirmation is there to protect you from unwantingly execute
   potentially dangerous commands.  For example, imagine a link

   : [[shell:rm -rf ~/*][Google Search]]

   In an Org-mode buffer, this command would look like /Google Search/,
   but really it would remove your home directory.  If you wish, you can
   make it easier to respond to the query by setting

   : (setq org-confirm-shell-link-function 'y-or-n-p
   :       org-confirm-elisp-link-function 'y-or-n-p).

   Then a single keypress will be enough to confirm those links.  It is
   also possible to turn off this check entirely, but I strongly
   recommend against this.  Be warned.

** Can I use RET or TAB to follow a link?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: RET-or-TAB-to-follow-link

#+index: Link!Follow

   Yes, this is how:

   : (setq org-tab-follows-link t)

** Can I keep mouse-1 clicks from following a link?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mouse-1-following-link
   :END:

   Activating links with =mouse-1= is a new feature in Emacs 22, to make
   link behavior similar to other applications like web browsers.  If
   you hold the mouse button down a bit longer, the cursor will be set
   without following the link.  If you cannot get used to this behavior,
   you can (as in Emacs 21) use =mouse-2= to follow links and turn off
   link activation for =mouse-1= with

   : (setq org-mouse-1-follows-link nil)

** How can I get completion of file names when creating a link?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: completion-of-file-links
   :END:

#+index: Link!Completion

You can use org-insert-link with a prefix argument:

: C-u C-c C-l

You will be greeted with prompt in the minibuffer that allows for file
completion using your preferred Emacs method for finding files.

** How can I use invisible targets within lists?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: invisible-targets-in-lists
   :END:

#+index: Target!Invisible

The usual way of turning radio links invisible is to comment them, but
Org comments need to be at the beginning of the line, which breaks list
indentation.

The workaround here is to add (INVISIBLE) after your <<target>>

For example:

: 11. <<target>>(INVISIBLE)
:     Some text
: 12. More text [[target][go to]]

** Org-mode is not opening mailto links in my default mail client
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mailto-links
   :END:

#+index: Link!Mailto

You can customize the function org-mode uses to open mailto links by
setting the variable =org-link-mailto-program=:

=M-x customize-variable org-link-mailto-program=

The default function called is =browse-url=, which opens a mail
composition buffer within Emacs. The type of buffer opened by
browse-url depends on the setting of the variable =mail-user-agent=.
Thus, if you want to ensure that mailto links use Gnus to open a
message buffer, you could add the following to your =.emacs=:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq mail-user-agent 'gnus-user-agent)
#+end_src

** Can I use CamelCase links?
   :PROPERTIES:

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: convert-itemized-to-enumerated-lists

   You can use =C-c -= or =S-<left>/<right>= to cycle through the various
   bullet headlines available for lists: =-, +, *, 1., 1)=.

   See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Plain-lists.html#Plain-lists][this section of the manual]] for more information.

** How can I convert plain lists to headlines and vice versa?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: convert-plain-lists-to-headlines
   :END:

#+index: List!Plain
#+index: Headline

   To convert a plain list item or line to a headline, type =C-c *= on
   the headline. This will make the line a subheading of the current
   headline.

   To convert a headline to a plain list item, type =C-c -= while the
   cursor is on the headline.

   To convert a headline to an unadorned line of text, type =C-c *= on
   the headline.

   You can use query replace to accomplish the same things, as Bernt
   Hansen explains in [[https://orgmode.org/list/871vvrym45.fsf@gollum.intra.norang.ca][this mailing list post]].

** How can I export alphabetical lists to... alphabetical lists?

=org-list-allow-alphabetical= allows you to use alphabetical lists in
Org, but this is purely visual, there is no effect on how the list is
exported.  It is simply exported as an /ordered/ list, just like when
you use numberes.  How the list will be represented in the export
depends on the backend.  For example, the style file of a LaTeX
document, or the CSS file for HTML documents set how ordered lists
should be represented.  It is good style to adhere to these general
settings because it keeps the overall document structure consistent.

See [[http://orgmode.org/list/87mwq6qtjk.fsf@gmail.com][this thread]] (and earlier ones) for a discussion about this.

   You can embed tables created with the =table.el= package in org-mode
   buffers, with mixed success when it comes to export and publishing.

** How can I make table alignment work with Asian character sets
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-alignment-asian-characters
   :END:

#+index: Table!Alignment

When table alignment fails, it usually has to do with character sets
where some characters have non-integer width.  Org will deal correctly
with characters that are one or two or three ASCII characters wide,
but not with characters that are, for example, 1.5 ASCII characters
wide.  To make table alignment work you need to switch to a different
character set.

** Can I plot data from a table?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: plotting-table-data
   :END:

#+index: Table!Plot
#+index: Table!Data

   Yes, you can, using org-plot.el written by Eric Schulte and now
   bundled with Org.  See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Org_002dPlot.html#Org-Plot][the manual section about this]].

   See also [[file:org-tutorials/org-plot.org][this excellent tutorial]] by Eric Schulte.

** How can I fill a table column with incremental numbers?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fill-table-column-with-incremental-numbers
   :END:

#+index: Table!Fill

Here is how: Use a field formula to set the first value in the column:

#+begin_src org
| N   |   |
|-----+---|
| :=1 |   |
|     |   |
|     |   |
|     |   |
,#+TBLFM: @2$1=1
#+end_src

Then define a column formula in the second field:

#+begin_src org
| N        |   |
|----------+---|
| 1        |   |
| =@-1 + 1 |   |
|          |   |
|          |   |
,#+TBLFM: @2$1=1
#+end_src

After recomputing the table, the column will be filled with
incremental numbers:

#+begin_src org
| N |   |
|---+---|
| 1 |   |
| 2 |   |
| 3 |   |
| 4 |   |
,#+TBLFM: $1=@-1 + 1::@2$1=1
#+end_src

Note that you could use arbitrary starting values and column formulas.

Alternatively, you can just start the table

#+begin_src org
| N |   |
|---+---|
| 1 |   |
#+end_src

and with the cursor on the 1, use S-RET (bound to org-table-copy-down). That
will add a row, incrementing the number as it goes. See the docstring for org-table-copy-down
for more information and also see the next FAQ entry [[=S-RET= in a table keeps increasing the copied numbers.  How can I stop this?]]
if you don't want this behavior.

** =S-RET= in a table keeps increasing the copied numbers.  How can I stop this?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: S-RET-in-a-table-increases-copied-numbers
   :END:

   Well, it is /supposed/ to be a feature, to make it easy to create a
   column with increasing numbers.  If this gets into your way, turn it
   off with

   : (setq org-table-copy-increment nil)

** Why does my table column get filled with #ERROR?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-column-filled-with-ERROR
   :END:

#+index: Table!#ERROR

   Org-mode tried to compute the column from other fields using a
   formula stored in the =#+TBLFM:= line just below the table, and
   the evaluation of the formula fails.  Fix the fields used in the
   formula, or fix the formula, or remove it!

** How can I stop the table editor from creating new lines?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-editor-creates-new-lines
   :END:

   When I am in the last column of a table and just above a horizontal
   line in the table, pressing TAB creates a new table line before the
   horizontal line.  To move to the line below the
   horizontal line instead, do this:

   Press =down= (to get on the separator line) and then =TAB=.
   Or configure the variable

   : (setq org-table-tab-jumps-over-hlines t)

** How can I get table fields starting with "="?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-fields-starting-with-=
   :END:

   With the setting

   : (setq org-table-formula-evaluate-inline nil)

   this will no longer happen.  You can still use formulas using the
   commands ~C-c =~ and ~C-u C-c =~

** How can I get a vertical bar "|" inside a table field?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-fields-with-vertical-bar
   :END:

   You can use =\vert= to put a vertical bar inside a table field.  This
   will be converted for export.  To use it inside a word use
   =abc\vert{}def=.  If you need something that looks like a bar in the Org
   mode buffer, you can use the unicode character brvbar which looks like
   this: \brvbar{}.

** How can I change the indentation of an entire table without fixing every line by hand?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: change-indentation-entire-table
   :END:

#+index: Table!Indentation

   The indentation of a table is set by the first line.  So just fix the
   indentation of the first line and realign with =TAB=.

** In my huge table the realigning after each TAB takes too long.  What can I do?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-realigning-after-TAB-takes-long
   :END:

#+index: Table!Realign

   Either split the table into several by inserting an empty line every
   100 lines or so.  Or turn off the automatic re-align with

   : (setq org-table-automatic-realign nil)

   After this the only way to realign a table is to press =C-c C-c=.  It
   will no longer happen automatically, removing the corresponding delays
   during editing.

** Recalculation of my table takes too long.  What can I do?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: Recalculation-of-my-table-takes-too-long
   :END:

#+index: Table!Calculation

   Nothing, really.  The spreadsheet in org is mostly done to make
   calculations possible, not so much to make them fast.  Since Org-mode is
   firmly committed to the ASCII format, nothing is stopping you from
   editing the table by hand.  Therefore, there is no internal
   representation of the data.  Each time Org-mode starts a computation, it
   must scan the table for special lines, find the fields etc.  This is
   slow.  Furthermore, Calc is slow compared to hardware computations.  To
   make this work with normal editing, recalculation is not happening
   automatically, or only for the current line, so that the long wait for a
   full table iteration only happens when you ask for it.

   So for really complex tables, moving to a "real" spreadsheet may
   still be the best option.

   That said, there are some ways to optimize things in Org-mode, and I
   have been thinking about moving a bit further down this line.
   However, for my applications this has so far not been an issue at
   all.  If you have a good case, you could try to convince me.

** When I export tables to HTML, they don't have borders.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-borders-in-html-export
   :END:

#+index: Table!HTML

By default, Org-mode exports tables without borders.

You can changed this by placing an =#+ATTR_HTML= line before the table:

:  #+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame all

See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tables-in-HTML-export.html#Tables-in-HTML-export][the manual]] for more details.

** Why does the Calc high precision (e. g. =p20=) not work like expected?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: table-high-precision
   :END:

- *Short answer*

  Avoid
  : | 1 / 2 * 3 | 0.16666667000000 |
  : #+TBLFM: $2 = $1; p20 %.14f

  and use
  : | 1 / 2 * 3 | 0.16666666666667 |
  : #+TBLFM: $2 = $1 +.0; p20 f-14

- *Longer answer*

  It is important to distinguish between the precision of
  1) =p20=: Calc internal calculation (=calc-internal-prec=)
  2) =f-14=: Calc float formatting, unlimited in precision (=calc-float-format=)
  3) =%.14f=: the =printf= reformatting, limited in precision

  See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Formula-syntax-for-Calc.html#Formula-syntax-for-Calc][the Org manual]] (org-version 6.35 or newer) for more details.

  Use =C-h v org-calc-default-modes RET= to check the Org default settings
  which are used if no format specifiers are added to a table formula.
  The examples below have been made with the out_of_the_box Org defaults
  =calc-internal-prec = 12= and =calc-float-format = 8=.

  Remember the formula debugger, toggled with =C-c {=,
  to view the processing stages like:
  |   | formula debugger label | processing stage           |
  | / | <                      | <>                         |

** How can I get automatic renumbering of footnotes in org-mode?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID:       footnote-auto-adjust
   :END:

#+index: Footnotes!Renumbering

You can add the following line to your .emacs file:

: (setq org-footnote-auto-adjust t)

Or, if you prefer, you can turn this option on locally by placing the
following line at the top of your org file:

: #+STARTUP: fnadjust

When auto-adjust is turned on, footnotes in the file with numerical
labels will be renumbered whenever a new footnote is added. Meanwhile,
all footnotes, including those with custom labels such
=[fn:custom-label ]=, will be sorted in the order of their appearance
in the text.

This emulates the footnote behavior that many users may be familiar
with from word-processing programs or from the footnote-mode included
with emacs.

If you do not turn on org-footnote-auto-adjust, you sort and/or
renumber footnotes at any time by calling org-footnote-action with a
prefix argument.

** Why isn't auto renumbering of footnotes turned on by default?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID:       why-no-default-auto-adjust
   :END:

Org-mode has a very robust footnote mechanism allowing for a variety of
types of footnotes. With some of the following footnote notations,
auto-adjust may be either irrelevant or undesired:

 - Automatically numbered
 - Footnotes with custom labels
 - Inline footnotes

In addition, Org-mode can be customized to place footnotes either at
the end of a document or at the end of the outline heading in which
they appear. Users who change this setting while editing a document
may be disconcerted to find all of their footnotes rearranged
automatically.

Make sure that the variable comment-start is nil.

** Are there any shortcuts for entering source blocks and comment lines?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: shortcuts-for-entering-source-blocks
   :END:

Org-mode has some [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html#Literal-examples][very convenient markup]] for including literal blocks and
lines of code in a file.  (This is especially useful when exporting
documents or using the contributed package [[file:org-contrib/babel/index.org][org-babel]] for executing blocks
of code.)

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src perl
print "Hello, world!\n";
,#+end_src
#+end_src

It can be tiresome to enter the block comment lines manually. There are
several possible shortcuts you can use to enter them:

1) Built-in expansion

   - Org-mode has a "secret" method of expanding source code blocks
     and comment lines.

   - If you type "<s" followed by =TAB= or =M-TAB=, a source block will
     magically appear.

   - For a full list of expansions, type =M-x describe-variable
     [RET] org-structure-template-alist=.

2) [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html#Literal-examples][Registers]]

   - Add the following line to your emacs file:

     =(set-register ?p "#+begin_src\n\n#+end_src perl")=

   - Then type =C-x r i p= to insert the source block. Please note: if
     you save another value to the register "p" with =C-x r s p=, it
     will overwrite the setting above for the current emacs session.

3) [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html#Literal-examples][Abbrevs]]

   - Activate the abbrev minor-mode in org-mode:

     + M-x abbrev-mode

     + /Permanently/:

       + =(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (abbrev-mode 1)))=

   - In org-mode, type "sbp" (a sample abbreviation for a perl source
     block).

   - Immediately after "sbp" type =C-x a i l=.

   - Enter the expansion:

     - =#+begin_src perl[C-q C-j][C-q C-j]#+end_src=

     - Note: =C-q C-j= creates a new line in the minibuffer

   - Now, whenever, you type sbp followed by =SPACE= or =RET= in an
     org-mode buffer, the src block will magically appear.

   - To review your list of abbrevs, type =M-x edit-abbrevs=.

4) [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SkeletonMode][Skeletons]]

   - Skeletons offer a simple way of automatically entering text.
     Here's a skeleton that queries for the type of block and wraps
     the active region inside it:

     #+begin_src elisp
       (define-skeleton skel-org-block
	 "Insert an org block, querying for type."
	 "Type: "
	 "#+begin_" str "\n"
	 _ - \n
	 "#+end_" str "\n")
     #+end_src

   - Simply type skel-org-block to insert the block.

     - You can bind this to a key.

     - You can also create an abbrev that invokes this function:

       : (define-abbrev org-mode-abbrev-table "blk" "" 'skel-org-block)

5) [[http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/][Yasnippet]]

   - Several org-mode users install yasnippet for convenient, complex
     expansion.

     yasnippet.

E.g. if you have a variable called =org-test-file= and you want the
variable =org-capture-templates= to "understand" (i.e. evaluate)

       "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")

   :PROPERTIES:

   Yes, this is possible.  Use the following code and make sure that
   after executing it, `my-start-clock-if-needed' is in
   `remember-mode-hook' /after/ `org-remember-apply-template'.

   : (add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'my-start-clock-if-needed 'append)

   :     (when (re-search-forward " *CLOCK-IN *" nil t)
   :       (replace-match "")
   :       (org-clock-in))))

   Then, when a template contains the key string CLOCK-IN, the clock
   will be started.  Starting with Org-mode version 5.20, the clock will
   automatically be stopped when storing the remember buffer.

** How can I change the advanced warning time for deadlines?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: warning-period-for-deadlines

#+index: DEADLINE!Warning

Deadline warnings appear in the daily agenda view a specified number
of days before the deadline is due. The default setting is 14 days.
You can change this with the variable =org-deadline-warning-days=.
(See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-scheduling.html#Deadlines-and-scheduling][this section]] of the manual.)

For instance,

: (setq org-deadline-warning-days 30)

would cause warnings for each deadline to appear 30 days in advance.

Naturally, you might not want warnings for all of your deadlines to
appear so far in advance. Thus, you can change the lead time for
individual items as follows:

: * TODO Get a gift for the party
:   DEADLINE: <2009-01-16 Fri -2d>

The "-2d" above changes the lead time for this deadline warning to two
days in advance. You can also use "w" for weeks and "m" for months.

** How can I postpone a task until a certain date?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: deferring-tasks

#+index: Postpone

The easiest way to postpone a task is to schedule it in the future.  For
instance, typing =C-c C-s +2w= on a headline will push a task two weeks
into the future, so that it won't show up on the daily agenda until two
weeks from now.

If you'd like to prevent the task from showing up on your global todo list,
you have a couple of options.

1. You can set the variable =org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled= to
   =t=.  This will exclude any scheduled items from your global list of
   active todos (=C-c a t=). (The variable
   =org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date= will exclude both scheduled and
   deadline items from your todo list).

2. You can remove the todo keyword from the item (C-c C-t <SPC>). The item
   will still appear on your agenda two weeks from today, but it won't show
   up on your todo lists.

** How can I limit the agenda view to my "work" tasks?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: limit-agenda-with-tag-filtering
   :END:

#+index: FILETAGS

   It is often convenient to group org files into separate categories, such
   as "home" and "work" (or "personal" and "professional"). One of the main
   reasons for such classification is to create agenda views that are
   limited by type of work or area of responsibility.  For instance, while
   at work, one may want to see only professional tasks; while away from
   work, one may want to see only personal tasks.

   One way to categorize files and tasks is to use a "#+FILETAGS"
   declaration at the top of each file, such as:

   : #+FILETAGS: work

   As long as org-use-tag-inheritance is turned on, the filetags will
   be inherited by all tasks in the file. A file can have multiple
   filetags. And, of course, tags can be added to individual headings.

   Tasks can be quickly filtered by tag from within the agenda by
   typing "/" and the name of the tag. The full key sequence to filter
   for work items in an agenda view would be:

   : C-c a a / work [or a tag shortcut]

** How can I limit the agenda view to a particular category?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: limit-agenda-with-category-match
   :END:

#+index: Agenda view!Category

   Another way to filter agenda views by type of work is to use a
   "#+CATEGORY" declaration at the top of each file, such as:

   : #+CATEGORY: work

   Categories can also be added to individual headings within a file:

   : * Big project
   :   :PROPERTIES:
   :   :CATEGORY: work
   :   :END:

   All todos belonging to the category "work" can be found a with a
   simple tags-todo search:

   : C-c a M

   At the prompt, type:

   : CATEGORY="work"

   The same results can be achieved with custom agenda commands, such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" tags-todo "CATEGORY=\"home\"")
	("w" tags-todo "CATEGORY=\"work\"")
	;; other custom agenda commands here
	))
#+END_SRC

** How can include all org files in a directory in my agenda?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: set-agenda-files-using-wildcards

#+index: Agenda!Directory

You can simply include the directory (as one of the items) in the value of
the variable org-agenda-files:

: (setq org-agenda-files '("/my/special/path/org/"))

There is another way of accomplishing the same end:

: (setq org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "/my/special/path/org/*.org"))

** Why aren't items disappearing from my agenda once they are marked done?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: removing-done-items-from-agenda
   :END:

If items remain on your daily/weekly agenda after they are marked done,
check the configuration of the following variables:

: org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done
: org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done
: org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done

For instance, type:

: M-x customize-variable RET org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done

If this variable is turned off (=nil=), then scheduled items will
remain on the agenda even after they are marked done.

If the variable is turned on (=t=), then scheduled items will
disappear from the agenda after they are marked done.

If these settings seem not to behave the way you expect, then make
sure you understand [[#scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp][the difference between SCHEDULED, DEADLINE, and
timestamps]].

** How do I keep repeating timestamps from being displayed multiple times?
   :PROPERTIES:

#+end_src

** What is the difference between SCHEDULED, DEADLINE, and plain timestamps?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: scheduled-vs-deadline-vs-timestamp
   :END:

#+index: SCHEDULED
#+index: DEADLINE
#+index: Timestamp

1. SCHEDULED items (set with =C-c C-s=) will appear on your agenda on
   the day they are scheduled and on every day thereafter until they
   are done. Schedule a task if you want to be reminded to do
   something beginning on a certain day and until it is done.

   : ** TODO Scheduled item
   :    SCHEDULED: <2009-03-01 Sun>

2. Items with a DEADLINE timestamp (set with =C-c C-d=) appear on your
   agenda in advance of the when they are due and remain on your
   agenda until they are done. Add a DEADLINE to an item if you want
   to make sure to complete it by a certain date. (The variable
   org-deadline-warning-days determines how far in advance items with
   deadlines will show up in the agenda. See [[#warning-period-for-deadlines][this FAQ]] for more
   information.)

   : ** TODO Item with a deadline
   :    DEADLINE: <2009-01-20 Tue>

3. An active timestamp (set with =C-c .=) will appear on your agenda
   only on the day it is scheduled. Use a timestamp for appointments
   or any reminders you want to show up only on a particular day.

   : ** TODO Item with an active timestamp
   : <2009-04-18 Sat>

Note: items with inactive timestamps (set with C-c ! and marked by
square brackets) will not show up in the agenda at all.

** Can I add files recursively to my list of agenda files?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: set-agenda-files-recursively
   :END:

Yes, you can use the library =find-lisp=.

: (load-library "find-lisp")
: (setq org-agenda-files (find-lisp-find-files "~/org" "\.org$"))

This will add all files ending in =org= in the directory "~/org"
and all of its subdirectories to your list of agenda files.

If on a *nix machine, you can also use the find utility, which can be
faster than the find-lisp library:

: (setq org-agenda-files
:       (mapcar 'abbreviate-file-name
:               (split-string
:                (shell-command-to-string "find ~/org -name \"*.org\"") "\n")))

** Why does an item appearing at the wrong time of day in my agenda?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: agenda-wrong-time-of-day
   :END:

When preparing the agenda view, org-mode scans each relevant headline for a
time designation.  This approach is very nice for adding free-form
timestamps to an item for scheduling.  Thus, either of the following work
would work to schedule an item at 10:00am:

#+begin_src org
,** 10:00am Get dried ice at the magic store
   SCHEDULED: <2009-05-27 Wed>
#+end_src

#+begin_src org
,** Get dried ice at the magic store
   SCHEDULED: <2009-05-27 Wed 10:00>
#+end_src

To enable this flexibility, org-mode scans the entire headline for time of
day notation. A potential problem can arise if you use inactive timestamps
in the headline to note when an item was created.  For example :

#+begin_src org
,** Get dried ice at the magic store [2009-05-26 Tue 12:58]
   SCHEDULED: <2009-05-27 Wed>
#+end_src

Org-mode would interpret the time in the inactive timestamp as a
time-of-day indicator and the entry would appear in your agenda at
12:58.

If you would like to turn off the time-of-day search, you can configure the
variable =org-agenda-search-headline-for-time= (requires org-mode >= 6.24).

** How can I change the visibility of an item from the agenda?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cycling-visibility-from-agenda

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook
   (lambda ()
     (define-key org-agenda-mode-map " " 'org-agenda-cycle-show)))
#+end_src

Then, as you press SPACE on an item on the agenda, it will cycle the
visibility of its original location.

If you work past midnight, you may not want your daily agenda view to
switch to the next day at 12 a.m. (the default). To extend your day, simply
set the value of org-extend-today-until to a positive number corresponding
to the number of hours you work past midnight. For example, the following
setting will cause the current day to extend until 6 a.m.

: (setq org-extend-today-until 6)

** How can I let a task repeat until a certain date?

   Since the org-mode agenda is much more powerful and can contain the
   diary, you should think twice before deciding to do this.  If you
   insist, however, integrating Org-mode information into the diary is
   possible.  You need to turn on /fancy diary display/ by setting in
   .emacs:

   : (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'diary-fancy-display)

   Then include the following line into your ~/diary file, in
   order to get the entries from all files listed in the variable
   =org-agenda-files=

   : &%%(org-diary)

   You may also select specific files with

   : &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/some/org-file.org
   : &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/another/org-file.org

   If you now launch the calendar and press ~d~ to display a
   diary, the headlines of entries containing a timestamp, date range,
   schedule, or deadline referring to the selected date will be listed.
   Just like Org-mode's agenda view, the diary for /today/ contains
   additional entries for overdue deadlines and scheduled items.  See
   also the documentation of the =org-diary= function.  Under XEmacs, it
   is not possible to jump back from the diary to the org, this works
   only in the agenda buffer.

#+index: Appointment

Org-mode's active timestamps work very well for scheduling individual
or recurring appointments, such as:

#+begin_src org
,* 8:00am Dentist appointment <2009-01-16 Fri>
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src org
,* Vacation
  <2009-03-20 Fri>--<2009-04-01 Wed>
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src org
,* Weekly meeting with boss
  <2009-01-20 Tue 14:00 +1w>
#+end_src

Sometimes, however, you need to set up more complicated recurring
appointments.  Org-mode has built-in support for many of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Sexp-Diary-Entries.html][the powerful sexp
entries]] that work in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html#Diary][Emacs diary]].

Let's say, for instance, that you teach a class that meets every Monday
evening between February 16 and April 20, 2009. The way to enter this an
org-mode file is:

#+begin_src org
,** Class 7:00pm-9:00pm
   <%%(and (= 1 (calendar-day-of-week date)) (diary-block 2 16 2009 4 20 2009))>
#+end_src

The expression above designates all Mondays that fall between February
16 and April 20. How exactly does it work?

 - (and... :: Indicates that *both* of the conditions that follow have
          to be true.

   - (= 1 (calendar-day-of-week date)) :: Is the day of the week a
        Monday?

       - Note: the function calendar-day-of-week converts the date to the day of week
	 expressed in numeric form, where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, and so on.

   - (diary-block 2 16 2009 4 20 2009) :: Does the date fall between
        these two dates?

You can make a sexp as complex as you like. If you wanted to omit a week
because of holidays, for instance, you could add another condition to the
sexp:

#+begin_src org
,** Class 7:00pm-9:00pm
   <%%(unless (diary-block 3 9 2009 3 13 2009) (and (= 1 (calendar-day-of-week date)) (diary-block 2 16 2009 4 20 2009)))>
#+end_src

The sexp above would omit Monday during the week of March 9, 2009. For
another way to accomplish the same thing, see [[#org-class][this FAQ]].

Another diary function commonly used for more complex scheduling is
diary-float. For instance,

#+begin_src org
,* Monthly meeting
  <%%(diary-float t 3 3)>
#+end_src

... would appear on the third Wednesday of every month.

For more ideas on how to create diary special expressions, see [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/DiaryMode][this
page on the Emacs wiki]].

** How can I schedule a weekly class that lasts for a limited period of time?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-class
   :END:

Org-mode offers a convenient diary sexp function for setting up a recurring
appointment that lasts for a certain period of time, such as a class. It is
called org-class and it can be entered as follows:

#+begin_src org
,** Class 7:00pm-9:00pm
   <%%(org-class 2009 2 16 2009 4 20 1 10)>
#+end_src

The function above schedules an appointment for every Monday (1)
between February 16 and April 20, 2009, except for ISO week 10 (March
1 to March 7).

If you would prefer not to place the timestamp in the headline, you can use
the following format:

#+begin_src org
,** Class
   <%%(org-class 2009 2 16 2009 4 20 1 10)> 7:00pm-9:00pm Class
#+end_src

In this case, the string following the sexp will be displayed in the
agenda.

The function org-class has the following format:

: (org-class Y1 M1 D1 Y2 M2 D2 DAYNAME &rest SKIP-WEEKS)

Y1/2, M1/2, and D1/2 indicate the beginning and ending dates. DAYNAME takes
the form of a number indicating the day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 =
Monday, and so on...). In addition, one can add an optional argument
SKIP-WEEKS to indicate weeks on the calendar that should be skipped. This
argument should be expressed as an ISO week number. You can find the number
by invoking emacs' built-in calendar (=M-x calendar=), navigating to the
appropriate week, and typing =p c (calendar-iso-print-date)=.  If one of
the SKIP-WEEKS is the symbol =holidays=, then any holidays known to the
calendar are also skipped.

Here is an alternative method, shared by Paul Sexton on the org mailing
list:

Let's say you are taking night classes in Spanish. The class is every
Wednesday evening at 7pm, starting on 18 August, and runs for 8
weeks.  Org-mode's timestamps do not support limited occurrences of
recurrent items -- you have to schedule the item with infinite recurrences,
then delete it when it finishes.

To schedule the Spanish classes, put the following in your =.emacs=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun diary-limited-cyclic (recurrences interval m d y)
    "For use in emacs diary. Cyclic item with limited number of recurrences.
  Occurs every INTERVAL days, starting on YYYY-MM-DD, for a total of
  RECURRENCES occasions."
    (let ((startdate (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian (list m d y)))
          (today (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian date)))
      (and (not (minusp (- today startdate)))
           (zerop (% (- today startdate) interval))
           (< (floor (- today startdate) interval) recurrences))))
#+end_src

The item in the org file looks like this:

#+begin_src org
,** 19:00-21:00 Spanish lessons
   <%%(diary-limited-cyclic 8 7 8 18 2010)>
#+end_src

** How can I set an event to occur every day except Saturday and Sunday?

#+begin_src org
,** Daily meeting
   <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 2 3 4 5))>
#+end_src

** How do I schedule events relative to Easter Sunday?

   Easter's date moves around from year to year according to a complicated
   set of criteria which I do not claim to understand.  However the
   following code will allow you to schedule recurring events relative to
   Easter Sunday.

   Note: the function da-easter is from [[http://github.com/soren/elisp/blob/master/da-kalender.el][da-kalender.el]].

   Put the following in your .emacs:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defun da-easter (year)
       "Calculate the date for Easter Sunday in YEAR. Returns the date in the
     Gregorian calendar, ie (MM DD YY) format."
       (let* ((century (1+ (/ year 100)))
              (shifted-epact (% (+ 14 (* 11 (% year 19))
                                   (- (/ (* 3 century) 4))
                                   (/ (+ 5 (* 8 century)) 25)
                                   (* 30 century))
                                30))
              (adjusted-epact (if (or (= shifted-epact 0)
                                      (and (= shifted-epact 1)
                                           (< 10 (% year 19))))
                                  (1+ shifted-epact)
                                shifted-epact))
              (paschal-moon (- (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                                (list 4 19 year))
                               adjusted-epact)))
         (calendar-dayname-on-or-before 0 (+ paschal-moon 7))))


     (defun da-easter-gregorian (year)
       (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute (da-easter year)))

     (defun calendar-days-from-easter ()
       "When used in a diary sexp, this function will calculate how many days
     are between the current date (DATE) and Easter Sunday."
       (- (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian date)
          (da-easter (calendar-extract-year date))))
    #+end_src

    Now we can schedule the public holidays associated with Easter as
    recurring events.  Good Friday is 2 days before "Easter", Easter Monday
    is one day after.

    #+begin_src org
    ,* Good Friday
      <%%(= -2 (calendar-days-from-easter))>

    ,* Easter Sunday
      <%%(= 0 (calendar-days-from-easter))>

    ,* Easter Monday
      <%%(= 1 (calendar-days-from-easter))>
    #+end_src

** How to schedule public holiday that is "the nearest Monday to DATE"?

   In New Zealand each regional capital has an "Anniversary Day". The date
   of Auckland's anniversary day is "the nearest Monday to 29 January".

   Put this in your =.emacs=:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defun calendar-nearest-to (target-dayname target-day target-month)
       "Recurring event that occurs in the nearest TARGET-DAYNAME to
     the date TARGET-DAY, TARGET-MONTH each year."
       (interactive)
       (let* ((dayname (calendar-day-of-week date))
              (target-date (list target-month target-day (calendar-extract-year date)))
              (days-diff (abs (- (calendar-day-number date)
                                 (calendar-day-number target-date)))))
         (and (= dayname target-dayname)
              (< days-diff 4))))
    #+end_src

   Now we can schedule Auckland Anniversary Day. The first argument, 1,
   means Monday (days of the week are numbered starting with Sunday=0).

Probably because you have not set the following variable:

The default value of this variable is t, which means that entries with
multiple timestamps, such as the following...

... will only appear in the agenda at the time specified by the first
timestamp. If you set =org-agenda-skip-additional-timestamps-same-entry= to
nil, the item will appear will appear at all the times you specify.

** How do I ignore a headline?

   This is one of the most common FAQs on the Org mailing list.  The

   the original headline.  Alternately, a more in depth discussion

   filters.  You can look at [[https://orgmode.org/list/20130719102315.GB9369@kuru.dyndns-at-home.com][this example]] on the mailing list.  For a

** How can I tell my calendar web application about appointments in my agenda files?

Here is what you need to do:

1. a script that calls Emacs in batch mode and produce a .ics file
2. a script that uploads this .ics file somewhere on the web
3. tell your webapp to fetch this .ics file on the web

Here is the script I use for the first step:

#+begin_src shell-script-mode
#!/bin/bash

/usr/local/bin/emacs --batch --eval \
"(progn (load-file \"~/install/git/org-mode/org.el\") \
        (load-file \"~/elisp/config/org-batch-config.el\") \
        (setq org-combined-agenda-icalendar-file \"~/org/cal/org.ics\")
        (setq org-agenda-files (quote (\"~/org/bzg.org\"))))" \
    -f org-export-icalendar-combine-agenda-files
#+end_src

Depending on your configuration, you might change the load sequence.

Here is the script I use for the second step:

#+begin_src shell-script-mode
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/rsync -rtv ~/org/org.ics -e ssh me@my_server:/home/me/public_html/
#+end_src

Note: if you want to cron this rsync script, you will need to let
=my_server= to know about your SSH public key.  Check [[http://troy.jdmz.net/rsync/index.html][this page]] as a
starter.

Now you can cron the two scripts above and your webapp will always be
up to date with your Org agendas.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: preserving-faces-during-batch-export
   :END:

#+index: Export!Agenda
#+index: Export!Faces

Normally, when you export an org file or an agenda view from within
emacs, htmlize will convert your face definitions to direct color css
styles inlined into each =<span>= object, resulting in an HTML output
that preserves the general look of your Org buffers and agenda views.

Let's say you generate an export from the command line, such as the
following:

: emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "e")'

or

: emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-publish-all)'

In such an instance, the exported HTML will contain only very basic
color styles. The reason is that when Emacs is run in batch mode, it
does not have a display and therefore only rudimentary face
definitions.  If you'd like to use more complex styles, you'll have to
make sure that the export process only assigns classes instead of
direct color values.  This can be done by binding the variable
=org-export-htmlize-output-style= to =css= for the duration of the
export, for example with

: emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs
:   -eval '(let ((org-export-htmlize-generate-css (quote css)))
:            (org-batch-agenda "e"))'

Then you can use a style file to make these classes look any way you
like.  To generate face definitions for a CSS file based on any faces
you are currently using in Emacs, you can use the following command:

: M-x org-export-htmlize-generate-css RET

This will generate a =<style>...</style>= section, the content of
which you can add to your style file.

** How can I include e.g. an abstract in export to Latex and HTML?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: include-abstract-in-export-to-latex-and-html
   :END:

#+index: Export!Abstract

Org does not currently have special markup for abstracts, but for
export purposes, you can extend the block-level structural and
semantic markup in Org with the contributed package [[file:org-contrib/org-special-blocks.org][org-special-blocks]]
(by Chris Gray). To turn it on, put this in your =.emacs=:

: (require 'org-special-blocks)

Now, you can mark up the abstract of your article like this:

: #+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
: Falling apples were observed and compared with pears. Newton's laws
: were confirmed at the 95% confidence level.
: #+END_ABSTRACT

Exporting to Latex wraps this in a
=\begin{abstract}....\end{abstract}= environment, which just works.

HTML export wraps it in a ~<div class="abstract">...</div>~
element. The HTML result won't look like anything special until you
style it. Here is some sample CSS to get you started; put these in
your document header:

: #+STYLE: <style>.abstract {margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border: 1px solid black}
: #+STYLE: .abstract:before {content: "Abstract: "; font-weight: bold}</style>

Generally, =#+begin_foo= will work for any simple Latex =foo=
environment not supported by existing Org markup.

If you need to pass parameters, process the block content in some way,
or support other exporters, you may want to consider whether you can
customize it using Eric Schulte's [[file:org-contrib/org-exp-blocks.org][org-exp-blocks]] instead.

** How can I get colored source code when exporting to LaTeX?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fontified_source_code_w_latex
   :END:

#+index: Export!LaTeX

As of Sun Aug 9 2009 the "current" version of Org-mode (see
[[#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development]]) supports exporting source
code to LaTeX using the listings package.

To turn on listing export add the following to your Org-mode
customization.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; requite org-latex so that the following variables are defined
  (require 'ox-latex)

  ;; tell org to use listings
  (setq org-latex-listings t)

  ;; you must include the listings package
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "listings"))

  ;; if you want colored source code then you need to include the color package
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "color"))
#+end_src

The listings package will now be used to fontify source code in your
LaTeX documents.  By default listings will not color any of your
source code.  If you would like to set colors for keywords and
comments in your latex documents you can do so using LaTeX directives
like the following.
#+begin_src latex
  \lstset{keywordstyle=\color{blue},
    commentstyle=\color{red},
    stringstyle=\color{green}
  }
#+end_src

of if you want to get even fancier with your colors you can try
something like the following
#+begin_src latex
\definecolor{keywords}{RGB}{255,0,90}
\definecolor{comments}{RGB}{60,179,113}
\definecolor{fore}{RGB}{249,242,215}
\definecolor{back}{RGB}{51,51,51}
\lstset{
  basicstyle=\color{fore},
  keywordstyle=\color{keywords},
  commentstyle=\color{comments},
  backgroundcolor=\color{back}
}
#+end_src

For more complex listings use cases consult the [[ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/listings.pdf][listings manual]].

** How can I export to Latex Beamer?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: beamer
   :END:

#+index: Export!Beamer

The latex [[http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/][Beamer Class]] is a useful class for generating slide shows.
The following can be used to export Org-mode documents to LaTeX
beamer.

Add the following to your Emacs initialization file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (unless (boundp 'org-latex-classes)
    (setq org-latex-classes nil))
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
               '("beamer"
                 "\\documentclass[11pt]{beamer}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n\\usepackage{hyperref}\n\\usepackage{verbatim}\n"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\begin{frame}\\frametitle{%s}" "\\end{frame}"
                  "\\begin{frame}\\frametitle{%s}" "\\end{frame}")))
#+end_src

Then by placing
: #+LaTeX_CLASS: beamer
in the header of your Org-mode document it will automatically export
to the Beamer document class on LaTeX export.  With the above
configuration top-level headers will be mapped to sections in the
Beamer document, second-level headers will be mapped to frames, and
lower level headlines will be mapped to itemize objects.

This above is adapted from an [[https://orgmode.org/list/9854.1246500519@gamaville.dokosmarshall.org][email by Nick Dokos]], and an [[https://orgmode.org/list/935736B7-18C4-4730-B765-D9E8463E9C84@tsdye.com][email by

** How can I use RefTeX in Org-mode files for LaTeX export and in Org-babel LaTeX code blocks?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: using-reftex-in-org-mode
   :END:

#+index: RefTeX
#+index: Babel
#+index: Code blocks

[[http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html][RefTeX]] is an indispensable tool for the author of LaTeX documents.  It
aids in creation of bibliographies, cross-references, indexes, and
glossaries.  RefTeX understands the structure of multi-file LaTeX
documents and is able to collect from them information about the
location(s) of external data stores used in creation of the final
document.  RefTeX was written by Carsten Dominik and is currently
being maintained by the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/index.html][AucTeX]] project.

*** Using RefTeX In Org-mode Files for LaTeX Export
In Org-mode files for LaTeX export, the trick is to find a way to tell
RefTeX the locations of external data stores.  One way is to set the
variable, =reftex-default-bibliography=.  Add lines like these to
.emacs:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq reftex-default-bibliography
        (quote
         ("default.bib" "other-default.bib")))
#+end_src

In practice, this is a limited solution and the
typical user will want to pass this information on a per-file basis.
Two solutions to this problem were posted on a blog, [[http://www.mfasold.net/blog/2009/02/using-emacs-org-mode-to-draft-papers/][Mario's
Braindump]].

The first solution, proposed by Mario, enables the RefTeX citation
function in Org-mode.  Add these lines to .emacs:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-mode-reftex-setup ()
    (load-library "reftex")
    (and (buffer-file-name)
         (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name))
         (reftex-parse-all))
    (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c )") 'reftex-citation))
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-mode-reftex-setup)
#+end_src

Then add the following lines anywhere in the Org-mode file (Org-mode
will recognize them as LaTeX commands):

#+begin_src org
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{BIB-NAME}
#+end_src

With this setup, =C-c )= will invoke =reftex-citation= which will
insert a reference in the usual way:

#+begin_src org
,* test reftex

This is a citation \cite{tierney90}.

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{tsd}
#+end_src

This Org-mode file will export the following LaTeX output:

#+begin_src latex :exports code
  % Created 2010-03-22 Mon 14:34
  \documentclass[11pt,letter]{article}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage{hyperref}

  \title{test.org}
  \author{Tom Dye}
  \date{2010-03-22 Mon}

  \begin{document}

  \maketitle

  \setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
  \tableofcontents
  \vspace*{1cm}

  \section{test reftex}
  \label{sec-1}


  This is a citation \cite{tierney90}.

  \bibliographystyle{plain}
  \bibliography{tsd}

  \end{document}
#+end_src


A second solution, to activate the RefTeX minor mode on a per-file
basis, was posted by Kevin Brubeck Unhammer in response to this idea.
Add the following lines to .emacs:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook ‘org-mode-hook
             (lambda ()
               (if (member “WRITE” org-todo-keywords-1)
                   (org-mode-article-modes))))
#+end_src

where =org-mode-article-modes= is defined as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-mode-article-modes ()
    (reftex-mode t)
    (bib-cite-minor-mode t)
    (and (buffer-file-name)
         (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name))
         (reftex-parse-all)))
#+end_src

Add the =\bibliographystyle{}= and =\bibliography{}= lines to the
Org-mode file as before and define a TODO keyword, =WRITE=, perhaps
like this:

#+begin_src org
,#+TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) WRITE | DONE(d) DEFERRED(f)
#+end_src

With this setup, you insert a citation with =M-x reftex-citation RET=.

*** Using RefTeX in Org-babel LaTeX Code Blocks

In Org-babel LaTeX code blocks, the trick is to give RefTeX access to
information in other Org-babel LaTeX code blocks.  If you use an Emacs
starter kit where configuration information is held in Org-mode files,
then the second solution is preferable because you won't be asked for
a master file when Emacs is started.  For this reason, the second
solution is modified for use with Org-babel latex code blocks.  No
key-binding is needed here because Org-babel code blocks are edited
within the usual AucTeX environment.

Add the following lines to .emacs (adapted from  Kevin Brubeck Unhammer's [[http://www.mfasold.net/blog/2009/02/using-emacs-org-mode-to-draft-papers/][Reftex Setup]])
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-mode-article-modes ()
    (reftex-mode t)
    (and (buffer-file-name)
         (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name))
         (reftex-parse-all)))

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (if (member "REFTEX" org-todo-keywords-1)
                  (org-mode-article-modes))))
#+end_src

Then add a line like the following line to the top of your org-mode file:

#+begin_src org
,#+TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) | DONE(d) DEFERRED(f) REFTEX
#+end_src

When you open an org-mode file with a line like this, RefTeX will
prompt for the master .tex file, which will be parsed in the usual
way.  This means that the .tex file should already exist, perhaps by
tangling the LaTeX preamble and postamble, before
=org-mode-article-modes= is activated for the Org-mode file.

** How can I use XeLaTeX for LaTeX export instead of pdfLaTeX?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: using-xelatex-for-pdf-export
   :END:

#+index: XeLaTeX
#+index: pdfLaTeX

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX][XeLaTeX]] is an alternative to pdfLaTeX for typesetting LaTeX
documents.  XeTeX can use any fonts installed in the operating system
without configuring TeX font metrics, and can make direct use of advanced
typographic features of OpenType and other font formats.  By default,
org-mode exports =org= files to =pdf= via pdfLaTeX.

Here is one way to smoothly incorporate XeLaTeX into org-mode's export
process.  This solution takes advantage of [[http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc][latexmk]], a perl script that
intelligently and automatically manages latex compilation.  It is included
with TeXLive, but at present the version included is not quite up-to-date
enough for our needs.  Version 4.20 and higher includes an option allowing
you to specify which program to use when "pdflatex" is called.  Install a
current version of latexmk as per the instructions on the [[http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc][latexmk]] site.  If
necessary, disable the older version that comes with TeXLive.  This is
likely in =/usr/texbin/=, and you should rename or remove it.  Then you can
put the following in your =~/.emacs.d/= or equivalent:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-latex)
  (setq org-latex-listings t)

  ;; Originally taken from Bruno Tavernier: https://orgmode.org/list/87zkv0pqyi.fsf@mundaneum.com

  (add-hook 'org-export-latex-after-initial-vars-hook 'my-auto-tex-parameters)
#+end_src

The =my-auto-tex-cmd= function looks at your =.org= file and checks whether
you've specified which latex to use. If there are no instructions, it just
runs regular old latex. If it finds the string =LATEX_CMD: pdflatex= in
your file, it runs pdflatex. If it finds =LATEX_CMD: xelatex=, it runs
xelatex. Because control is handed off to latexmk, nothing else is needed:
it takes care of figuring things out so that the references and citations
are correct.

The second half of the code above specifies the latex packages that will be
included in the =.tex= file. The variable =org-latex-packages-alist=
specifies a list of packages that are always included in the header of
latex documents, regardless of how they are compiled. The variable
=org-latex-default-packages-alist= adds additional packages
depending on whether latex/pdflatex or xelatex is being used. You can
change the content of these as needed.

Finally, the =org-latex-classes= variable redefines elements of the
=.tex= file's preamble for the xelatex case. These can also be customized
as needed.

By way of example, an =.org= file you want compiled with xelatex might
contain the following header:

: #+TITLE: My Paper
: #+AUTHOR: Jane Doe
: #+DATE:
: #+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil
: #+LATEX_CMD: xelatex
: #+LATEX_HEADER: \setsansfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Unit-Bold}
: #+LATEX_HEADER: \setmonofont[Mapping=tex-text,Scale=MatchLowercase]{PragmataPro}
: #+LATEX_HEADER: \setromanfont[Mapping=tex-text,Numbers=OldStyle]{Minion Pro}

If you always want to have the same font setup in your xelatex documents,
the =fontspec= commands setting the font choices can be put in the
=org-latex-classes= setting instead.

The upshot is that when you want to export an =.org= file using XeLaTeX,
you can now simply make sure the line =LATEX_CMD: xelatex= is in your
=.org= file, then do =C-c C-e d= as usual, and org-mode, with latexmk in
the background, does the rest for you.

** Why is my exported PDF file almost unreadable?
   :PROPERTIES:

Some PDF viewers (earlier versions (< v6) of Acrobat Reader, Evince,
possibly others) do not get along with Adobe Type3 fonts, producing almost
unreadable screen output (printed output is OK). If you see this, first
verify the fonts that your document uses: open it with Acrobat Reader or
Evince, select "Properties" from the "File" menu and click on the "Fonts"
tab; alternatively, you can use the pdffonts program (part of the
xpdf-reader package) from the command line.  If that is indeed the problem,
then either use a different viewer or install Type1 versions of the

Orgmode exports natively to =OpenDocument= format using =org-odt= module.

The key bindings for export are =C-c C-e o= and =C-c C-e O=.

If you don't see =OpenDocumentText= as an option under =C-c C-e= you need
to upgrade to =Org-mode 7.6= by one of the following means:

1. Install org-7.6 using a distribution .zip or .tar.gz file, or
   through Git. Then do the following:
   1. Add =contrib/lisp= to the load-path in your =.emacs=
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       ;; modify org-root-dir as needed
       (add-to-list 'load-path "org-root-dir/contrib/lisp")
    #+end_src
   2. Do =M-x customize-variable RET org-modules RET= and enable the
      =odt= option

2. Upgrade to (atleast) the =Emacs-24.1 pretest= version. Install
   =org-odt= package using =M-x list-packages=.

#+begin_comment

- Use existing exporters

  Export to one of org-mode's supported export formats and then use an
  external tool or method to convert the exported file to doc or odt.

  With simple documents, these methods work well. However for complex
  documents containing footnotes, embedded images, math formuale etc
  the results may be less than satisfactory. (Note, the lists below
  are by no means comprehensive).
  1. html -> odt/doc/rtf
     - open html in Open Office and save as odt/doc ([[https://orgmode.org/list/87lj6btkim.wl%ucecesf@ucl.ac.uk][see this post by
  	Eric Fraga]])
     - [[http://www.artofsolving.com/opensource/pyodconverter][PyODConverter]]
     - [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/][Pandoc]] (this works for LaTeX and docbook as well)
     - (Mac only) The [[http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#DOCUMENTATION/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html][textutil]] utility bundled with OS X can convert
  	from html to doc
  2. LaTeX -> odt/doc/rtf
      - [[http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/][LaTeX2rtf]] (works well with index, footnotes, and references)
      - [[http://www.tug.org/tex4ht/][TeX4ht]] (works with more complex latex elements, though can be

Typically the corruption of =odt= file happens when the XML emitted by
Org is not well-formed according to =OpenDocument schema=.

If you encounter corruption issues please identify the root cause
using one of the methods described below:

- Use an Online validator
  - Pass the exported document through the [[http://tools.services.openoffice.org/odfvalidator/][ODF Validator]] and note down
    the errors.

- Use Emacs' in-built validator
  1. Switch to =*.odt= buffer =(C-x b whatever.odt)=
  2. Open the =content.xml= file - =(Hit RET on content.xml)=
  3. Do a =C-u C-c C-n= - =(M-x rng-first-error)=
  4. Note the error message, the XML markup at the point of error and
     the surrounding context.

Once you have identified the error
1. Create a minimal org file that reproduces the error.
2. Post a bug-report to =emacs-orgmode@gnu.org=.

** How can I specify ODT export styles?

#+index: Export!odt style

Check the variable =org-export-odt-styles-file=.  Here is its docstring,
as of Org version 7.8:

: org-export-odt-styles-file is a variable defined in `org-odt.el'.
: Its value is nil
:
: Documentation:
: Default styles file for use with ODT export.
: Valid values are one of:
: 1. nil
: 2. path to a styles.xml file
: 3. path to a *.odt or a *.ott file
: 4. list of the form (ODT-OR-OTT-FILE (FILE-MEMBER-1 FILE-MEMBER-2
: ...))
:
: [snip]
:
: Use "#+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ..." directive to set this variable on
: a per-file basis.  For example,
:
: #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: "/path/to/styles.xml" or
: #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("/path/to/file.ott" ("styles.xml" "image/hdr.png")).
:
: You can customize this variable.

** Can I omit the title in the LaTeX export?

Yes: simply use a blank #+TITLE in your Org file.

** How can I use arbitrary colors for words/sentences in HTML export?

Add the following to your Emacs config,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; -*- emacs-lisp -*-
    (org-add-link-type
     "color"
     (lambda (path)
       (message (concat "color "
                        (progn (add-text-properties
                                0 (length path)
                                (list 'face `((t (:foreground ,path))))
                                path) path))))
     (lambda (path desc format)
       (cond
        ((eq format 'html)
         (format "<span style=\"color:%s;\">%s</span>" path desc))
        ((eq format 'latex)
         (format "{\\color{%s}%s}" path desc)))))
#+END_SRC

and then you can use

: [[color:red][red]]

for colored export.

** How can I suppress the page number in the footer of an exported PDF?
#+index: Export!pdf
#+index: pdfLaTeX

Use the following directive in your Org file:

: #+LATEX: \thispagestyle{empty}

* Backup

#+index: Backup

Since =org= files are so central to your life, you probably want to back
them up in a safe place.

If the =org= file you want to back up are in a single directory, the
preferred method is to us a =RCS= (Revision Control System) -- pick up your
favorite ([[http://git-scm.com/][git]], [[http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/][bazaar]], [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/][mercurial]], [[http://subversion.apache.org/][subversion]], [[http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/][cvs]], etc.).  Depending on the
RCS you use and how you use it, you can have a /local/ backup or sync it on
a remote place.

If you want to store all your =org= files from your =$HOME= to a single
=~/org/backup/= folder, you can use this shell script (as [[https://orgmode.org/list/AANLkTimemfOeZFYajbpeW09OOJ87CVo-cTnarK-E=c3h@mail.gmail.com][suggested by
Suvayu Ali]]):

#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p ~/org/backup && \
find $HOME -type f -name '*\.org' ! -path "$HOME/org/backup/*" \
     -exec cp -t ~/org/backup/ \{\} \;
#+end_src

It will recursively search for =org= files in your =$HOME= directory
(except those in =~/org/backup/=) and copy them to =~/org/backup/=.
You can then use rsync to make sure =~/org/backup/= also lives on a
remote and safe place.

* Org-mode on mobile devices

#+index: MobileDevices

** What mobile apps for org-mode are available?

These are the most popular apps for keeping notes in org-mode format
on mobile devices:

- MobileOrg for *iOS*, created by Richard Moreland.  Check out [[https://mobileorg.github.io][the project's page]].
- Orgzly for *Android*. See [[http://www.orgzly.com/][the project's page]].
- Organice, a React-based [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application][Progressive Web App (PWA)]] for any device
  with a browser.  Syncs with Dropbox, Google Drive, and WebDAV.  Can
  be self-hosted, or simply use [[https://organice.200ok.ch/][the public instance]].  Check out [[https://organice.200ok.ch/documentation.html][the
  documentation]] for more info.

There is also an app called MobileOrg for *Android* which is now
unmaintained and not fully compatible with recent versions of
Android. See [[http://wiki.github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/][the project page]].

** Can I use the same files on my mobile device as on my computer?

Absolutely! Depending on the mobile app and your preferences, a number
of options are available.

*** Synchronizing using the MobileOrg protocol

Org-mode in Emacs has a builtin protocol for synchronizing and merging
changes from the mobile device. This protocol is supported by
MobileOrg for iOS and by the (unmaintained) MobileOrg for Android, but
*not* by Orgzly. Synchronization is initiated from within Emacs, which
needs to fetch a file containing only the changes in a
MobileOrg-specific file format. The file can be retrieved:

- via [[http://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox.com]] (easier to set up, free accounts available)
- via [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] (open source and self hosted, potentially more data privacy)
- via a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV][WebDAV]] server of your choice (potentially more data privacy)

**** How does synchronization via WebDAV work?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mobileorg_webdav
   :END:

You need to create a dedicated directory on the WebDAV server for the
communication between Emacs and MobileOrg.

#+begin_src ditaa :file images/orgmobile-tramp-webdav.png :cmdline -r
  +----------------------+           +----------------------+
  | desktop              |           | WebDAV server        |

#+RESULTS:

If you can mount that directory locally so that Emacs can directly
write to it, just set the variable =org-mobile-directory= to point to
that directory.  Alternatively, by using the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][/TRAMP/]] method,
=org-mobile-directory= may point to a remote directory accessible
through, for example, /ssh/ and /scp/:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-mobile-directory "/scpc:user@remote.host:org/webdav/")
#+end_src

  {{{BeginWarningBox}}} N.B. Since this configures /TRAMP/ to connect
  via /ssh/, you will need to use your /ssh/ password, not a WebDAV
  password.

  Also note that if you have configured ssh to use =ControlPersist=, due
  to [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tramp-devel/2012-03/msg00010.html][a bug with tramp and =ControlPersist=]] you may need to use =scpx=
  instead of =scp= as the /tramp/ transfer method.{{{EndWarningBox}}}

**** Does Emacs have to use /TRAMP/ to access the remote directory?

No, you can alternatively use a local directory for staging.  Other
means must then be used to keep this directory in sync with the WebDAV
directory.  In the following example, files are staged in =~/stage/=,
and Org-mode hooks take care of moving files to and from the WebDAV
directory using /scp/.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-mobile-directory "~/stage/")
(add-hook 'org-mobile-post-push-hook
  (lambda () (shell-command "scp -r ~/stage/* user@wdhost:mobile/")))
(add-hook 'org-mobile-pre-pull-hook
  (lambda () (shell-command "scp user@wdhost:mobile/mobileorg.org ~/stage/ ")))
(add-hook 'org-mobile-post-pull-hook
  (lambda () (shell-command "scp ~/stage/mobileorg.org user@wdhost:mobile/")))
#+end_src

Alternatively you could write a simple script to synchronize from
=~/stage/= to the remote directory via /rsync/.

*** Synchronizing with Syncthing or Dropbox directly

Among Orgzly users it is popular to synchronize the org files
themselves (rather than just the changesets) with [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] or
[[http://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox.com]]. This method provides no way of merging parallel edits, so
you must ensure that a synchronization is performed when switching
device, or you'll be in trouble. [[https://medium.com/@JosephKiran/replacing-cloud-based-to-do-apps-with-orgzly-and-syncthing-6a065419d61][This blog post]] provides some details
for using Orgzly with Syncthing.

*** Synchronizing with Git and a shell script

An option which is attractive if you already prefer to have your org
files version controlled by git is to initiate synchronization from a
shell script on the computer, and handle merge conflicts with git
merges. Edits made in parallel will be visible as parallel branches in
the git log, and most conflicts should be handled by the
auto-merger. [[https://pantarei.xyz/posts/sync-org-mode-with-mobile/][This blog post]] provides such a script with setup
instructions.

* Mathjax

#+index: Mathjax

** How to install MathJax on my server?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: install_mathjax_on_server
:END:

Org uses MathJax as its default HTML display engine for equations.

Org relies on the version of MathJax available from orgmode.org, but you
might want to use another version and install MathJax on your own server.

1. Download a [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mathjax/files/][MathJax archive]].

2. Upload it somewhere on your server (say http://me.org/mathjax/)

3. Set the correct path in =org-export-html-mathjax-options= (i.e. replace
   https://orgmode.org/mathjax/MathJax.js by
   http://me.org/mathjax/MathJax.js)

You can also get [[http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?installation.html][MathJax from git or svn]] -- in this case, be careful not to
forget to unzip the fonts.zip archive in the mathjax directory.

** Problems with LaTeX macros with #+latex or #+begin_latex
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Problems-with-LaTeX-macros-with-#+latex-or-#+begin_latex
  :END:

#+index: LaTeX!Macro

Org's LaTeX exporter has a difficult job on its hands and even though it
does a great job most of the time, there are times when it falls short. One
situation that has arisen a few times in the past is when a macro
definition or use includes an opening brace, but the corresponding closing
brace is on a different line. That has caused LaTeX compilation problems or
mysterious excisions of content - see for example the following two threads
in the mailing list:

 - https://orgmode.org/list/87r5abi1tn.fsf@fastmail.fm

 - https://orgmode.org/list/BANLkTikRuyA7_sCC3pyVEHsJ0KXtP88_xw@mail.gmail.com

In both cases, the exporter was getting confused by the opening brace which
did not have a corresponding closing brace on the same line. Although the
first of these cases is fixed in current Org, there might be more such
cases or there might be a regression which causes the incorrect behavior
again. While waiting for a fix, it's worth trying out the simple workaround
of including a fake closing brace on the same line as the opening brace but
*commenting it out* so that LaTeX never sees it.  That is often enough to
make the exporter behave properly. In other words, to take one of the
examples above, instead of writing

: #+latex: \custommacro {
: ...
: #+latex: }

use the following idiom instead:

: #+latex: \custommacro { % hide the closing brace in a LaTeX comment }
: ...
: #+latex: }

I emphasize that this is a workaround, not a fix: if you do run into such
a case and the workaround fixes it, at least you can continue working, but
please submit a bug report so that it can be fixed properly.
